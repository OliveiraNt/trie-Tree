adventure  i  a scandal in bohemia

i


to sherlock holmes she is always the woman i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory

i had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us away from each other my own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion

one nightit was on the twentieth of march i was returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street as i passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story he was at work again he had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own

his manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion

wedlock suits you he remarked i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you

seven i answered

indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness

then how do you know

i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl

my dear holmes said i this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out

he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together

it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession

i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours

quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room

frequently

how often

well some hundreds of times

then how many are there

how many i dont know

quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table it came by the last post said he read it aloud

the note was undated and without either signature or address

there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask

this is indeed a mystery i remarked what do you imagine that it means

i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it

i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written

the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff

peculiarthat is the very word said holmes it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light

i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper

what do you make of that asked holmes

the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather

not at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves eglow eglonitzhere we are egria it is in a germanspeaking countryin bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and papermills ha ha my boy what do you make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette

the paper was made in bohemia i said

precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentencethis account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts

as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmes whistled

a pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in this case watson if there is nothing else

i think that i had better go holmes

not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it

but your client

never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention

a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud and authoritative tap

come in said holmes

a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy

you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent i told you that i would call he looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address

pray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honour to address

you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone

i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me

the count shrugged his broad shoulders then i must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history

i promise said holmes

and i

you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own

i was aware of it said holmes dryly

the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia

i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes

our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client

if your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise you

the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you are right he cried i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it

why indeed murmured holmes your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of casselfelstein and hereditary king of bohemia

but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you

then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more

the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you

kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who had written a monograph upon the deepsea fishes

let me see said holmes hum born in new jersey in the year  contraltohum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsawyes retired from operatic stageha living in londonquite so your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back

precisely so but how

was there a secret marriage

none

no legal papers or certificates

none

then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity

there is the writing

pooh pooh forgery

my private notepaper

stolen

my own seal

imitated

my photograph

bought

we were both in the photograph

oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion

i was madinsane

you have compromised yourself seriously

i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now

it must be recovered

we have tried and failed

your majesty must pay it must be bought

she will not sell

stolen then

five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result

no sign of it

absolutely none

holmes laughed it is quite a pretty little problem said he

but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully

very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph

to ruin me

but how

i am about to be married

so i have heard

to clotilde lothman von saxemeningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end

and irene adler

threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not gonone

you are sure that she has not sent it yet

i am sure

and why

because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday

oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the present

certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm

then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress

pray do so i shall be all anxiety

then as to money

you have carte blanche

absolutely

i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph

and for present expenses

the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table

there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said

holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him

and mademoiselles address he asked

is briony lodge serpentine avenue st johns wood

holmes took a note of it one other question said he was the photograph a cabinet

it was

then goodnight your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and goodnight watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three oclock i should like to chat this little matter over with you

ii


at three oclock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight oclock in the morning i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be i was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head

it was close upon four before the door opened and a drunkenlooking groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room accustomed as i was to my friends amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes

well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair

what is it

its quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing

i cant imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler

quite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you however i left the house a little after eight oclock this morning in the character of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know all that there is to know i soon found briony lodge it is a bijou villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock to the door large sittingroom on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coachhouse i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest

i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of halfandhalf two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to

and what of irene adler i asked

oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the serpentinemews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentinemews and knew all about him when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign

this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation

i am following you closely i answered

i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the man of whom i had heard he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home

he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms of her i could see nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he shouted first to gross  hankeys in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes

away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles it hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for

 the church of st monica john she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes

this was quite too good to lose watson i was just balancing whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could object the church of st monica said i and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twentyfive minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind

my cabby drove fast i dont think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived i paid the man and hurried into the church there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me

 thank god he cried youll do come come

 what then i asked

 come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal

i was halfdragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion

this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i and what then

well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements

which are

some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your cooperation

i shall be delighted

you dont mind breaking the law

not in the least

nor running a chance of arrest

not in a good cause

oh the cause is excellent

then i am your man

i was sure that i might rely on you

but what is it you wish

when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her

and what then

you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand

i am to be neutral

to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sittingroom window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window

yes

you are to watch me for i will be visible to you

yes

and when i raise my handsoyou will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me

entirely

it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigarshaped roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumbers smokerocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it selflighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear

i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street

precisely

then you may entirely rely on me

that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play

he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simpleminded nonconformist clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime

it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected on the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissorsgrinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nursegirl and several welldressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths

you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a doubleedged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph

where indeed

it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her

where then

her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house

but it has twice been burgled

pshaw they did not know how to look

but how will you look

i will not look

what then

i will get her to show me

but she will refuse

she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter

as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissorsgrinder who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man irene adler as i will still call her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street

is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked

he is dead cried several voices

no no theres life in him shouted another but hell be gone before you can get him to hospital

hes a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah hes breathing now

he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm

surely bring him into the sittingroom there is a comfortable sofa this way please

slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me i hardened my heart and took the smokerocket from under my ulster after all i thought we are not injuring her we are but preventing her from injuring another

holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the window at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and illgentlemen ostlers and servant maidsjoined in a general shriek of fire thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road

you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have been better it is all right

you have the photograph

i know where it is

and how did you find out

she showed me as i told you she would

i am still in the dark

i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening

i guessed as much

then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick

that also i could fathom

then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do and into her sittingroom which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance

how did that help you

it was allimportant when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewelbox now it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bellpull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little overprecipitance may ruin all

and now i asked

our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands

and when will you call

at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay

we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said

goodnight mister sherlock holmes

there were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by

ive heard that voice before said holmes staring down the dimly lit street now i wonder who the deuce that could have been

iii


i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room

you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face

not yet

but you have hopes

i have hopes

then come i am all impatience to be gone

we must have a cab

no my brougham is waiting

then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodge

irene adler is married remarked holmes

married when

yesterday

but to whom

to an english lawyer named norton

but she could not love him

i am in hopes that she does

and why in hopes

because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majestys plan

it is true and yet well i wish she had been of my own station what a queen she would have made he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue

the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham

mr sherlock holmes i believe said she

i am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze

indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the  train from charing cross for the continent

what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise do you mean that she has left england

never to return

and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost

we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom followed by the king and myself the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way

my dear mr sherlock holmesyou really did it very well you took me in completely until after the alarm of fire i had not a suspicion but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i began to think i had been warned against you months ago i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you and your address had been given me yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after i became suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman but you know i have been trained as an actress myself male costume is nothing new to me i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives i sent john the coachman to watch you ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as i call them and came down just as you departed

well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes then i rather imprudently wished you goodnight and started for the temple to see my husband

we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow as to the photograph your client may rest in peace i love and am loved by a better man than he the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future i leave a photograph which he might care to possess and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes


very truly yours              
irene norton nee adler

what a womanoh what a woman cried the king of bohemia when we had all three read this epistle did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen is it not a pity that she was not on my level

from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majestys business to a more successful conclusion

on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire

i am glad to hear your majesty say so

i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand

your majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes

you have but to name it

this photograph

the king stared at him in amazement

irenes photograph he cried certainly if you wish it

i thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honour to wish you a very good morning he bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers

and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a womans wit he used to make merry over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late and when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman

adventure  ii  the redheaded league


i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me

you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially

i was afraid that you were engaged

so i am very much so

then i can wait in the next room

not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also

the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fatencircled eyes

try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures

your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed

you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination

a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting

you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique

the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance

i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherds check trousers a not overclean black frockcoat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed tophat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features

sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else

mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion

how in the name of goodfortune did you know all that mr holmes he asked how did you know for example that i did manual labour its as true as gospel for i began as a ships carpenter

your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed

well the snuff then and the freemasonry

i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arcandcompass breastpin

ah of course i forgot that but the writing

what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk

well but china

the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple

mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all

i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson

yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir

i took the paper from him and read as follows

to the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania u s a there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of  a week for purely nominal services all redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twentyone years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league  popes court fleet street

what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement

holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isnt it said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date

it is the morning chronicle of april   just two months ago

very good now mr wilson

well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business

what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes

his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head

why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement

oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in him

he is still with you i presume

yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place cleanthats all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more

the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says

 i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a redheaded man

 why that i asks

 why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the redheaded men its worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change colour heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into

 why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stayathome man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the doormat in that way i didnt know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news

 have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men he asked with his eyes open

 never

 why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies

 and what are they worth i asked

 oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupations

well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy

 tell me all about it said i

 well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself redheaded and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do

 but said i there would be millions of redheaded men who would apply

 not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds

now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement

i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with redheaded folk and popes court looked like a costers orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they werestraw lemon orange brick irishsetter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flamecoloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office

your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement

there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us

 this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league

 and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success

 it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobblers wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a redhead to be seen except my own and that of the manager

 my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family

i answered that i had not

his face fell immediately

 dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the redheads as well as for their maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor

my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right

 in the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties

 well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i

 oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding i should be able to look after that for you

 what would be the hours i asked

 ten to two

now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before payday so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up

 that would suit me very well said i and the pay

 is  a week

 and the work

 is purely nominal

 what do you call purely nominal

 well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time

 its only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i

 no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet

 and the work

 is to copy out the encyclopaedia britannica there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blottingpaper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready tomorrow

 certainly i answered

 then goodbye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune

well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the encyclopaedia britannica vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quillpen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for popes court

well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he bade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me

this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weeks work it was the same next week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it

eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end

to an end

yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself

he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper it read in this fashion


the redheaded league

is

dissolved

october  


sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter

i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere

no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen i really wouldnt miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door

i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the redheaded league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him

 well said i the gentleman at no 

 what the redheaded man

 yes

 oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday

 where could i find him

 oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes  king edward street near st pauls

i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross

and what did you do then asked holmes

i went home to saxecoburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you

and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear

grave enough said mr jabez wilson why i have lost four pound a week

as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some  to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them

no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prankif it was a prankupon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds

we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisementhow long had he been with you

about a month then

how did he come

in answer to an advertisement

was he the only applicant

no i had a dozen

why did you pick him

because he was handy and would come cheap

at half wages in fact

yes

what is he like this vincent spaulding

small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead

holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement i thought as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings

yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad

hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with you

oh yes sir i have only just left him

and has your business been attended to in your absence

nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a morning

that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two today is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion

well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all

i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most mysterious business

as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter

what are you going to do then i asked

to smoke he answered it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece

sarasate plays at the st jamess hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours

i have nothing to do today my practice is never very absorbing

then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along

we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxecoburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedin enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our redheaded client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in

thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand

third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door

smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before

evidently said i mr wilsons assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the redheaded league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him

not him

what then

the knees of his trousers

and what did you see

what i expected to see

why did you beat the pavement

my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxecoburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it

the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxecoburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted

let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london there is mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriagebuilding depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violinland where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no redheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums

my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st jamess hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down

you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged

yes it would be as well

and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious

why serious

a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but today being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help tonight

at what time

ten will be early enough

i shall be at baker street at ten

very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd

i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the redheaded copier of the encyclopaedia down to the visit to saxecoburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from holmes that this smoothfaced pawnbrokers assistant was a formidable mana man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation

it was a quarterpast nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sadfaced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frockcoat

ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his peajacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in tonights adventure

were hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down

i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily

you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force

oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for sevenandtwenty years that i have not had my rubber

i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some  and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands

john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet

i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second

sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into farrington street

we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us

we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes

you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him

nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise

i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere

the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket

we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present

it is our french gold whispered the director we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it

your french gold

yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose  napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains  napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject

which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern

and sit in the dark

i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carree you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down

i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault

they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through the house into saxecoburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones

i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door

then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait

what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light

at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones

its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a cleancut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulderhigh and waisthigh until one knee rested upon the edge in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair

its all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the bags great scott jump archie jump and ill swing for it

sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor

its no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no chance at all

so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coattails

there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes

oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you

and i you holmes answered your redheaded idea was very new and effective

youll see your pal again presently said jones hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies

i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please 

all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the policestation

that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective

really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience

i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the redheaded league

you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the encyclopaedia must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair the  a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation

but how could you guess what the motive was

had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the mans business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something out of the house what could it be i thought of the assistants fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellarsomething which took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once more i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building

so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen

and how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight i asked

well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presencein other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come tonight

you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true

it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do so

and you are a benefactor of the race said i

he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked  lhomme cest rienloeuvre cest tout as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand

adventure  iii  a case of identity


my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the crosspurposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most outre results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable

and yet i am not convinced of it i answered the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic

a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace

i smiled and shook my head i can quite understand your thinking so i said of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but herei picked up the morning paper from the groundlet us put it to a practical test here is the first heading upon which i come a husbands cruelty to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude

indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average storyteller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example

he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it

ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers

and the ring i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger

it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems

and have you any on hand just now i asked with interest

some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken

he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutraltinted london street looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell

i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts

as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a fullsailed merchantman behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him

do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting

i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad goodhumoured face youve heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that

never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook if not why should you come to consult me

i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me im not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel

why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked sherlock holmes with his fingertips together and his eyes to the ceiling

again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland yes i did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibankthat is my fathertook it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away to you

your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different

yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself

and your mother is alive

oh yes mother is alive and well i wasnt best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got  for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been alive

i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention

your own little income he asked does it come out of the business

oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying   per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest

you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 

i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them of course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day

you have made your position very clear to me said holmes this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel

a flush stole over miss sutherlands face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket i met him first at the gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sundayschool treat but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all fathers friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel

i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball

oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way

i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel

yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more

no

well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet

but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you

well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know

were you engaged to the gentleman at this time

oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmermr angelwas a cashier in an office in leadenhall streetand

what office

thats the worst of it mr holmes i dont know

where did he live then

he slept on the premises

and you dont know his address

noexcept that it was leadenhall street

where did you address your letters then

to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of

it was most suggestive said holmes it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel

he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his voice was gentle hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare

well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france

mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him i didnt quite like that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didnt want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding

it missed him then

yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived

ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for the friday was it to be in church

yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviours near kings cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a fourwheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the fourwheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him

it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said holmes

oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed strange talk for a weddingmorning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it

most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him

yes sir i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so and then i think that what he foresaw happened

but you have no notion as to what it could have been

none

one more question how did your mother take the matter

she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again

and your father did you tell him

yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what could have happened and why could he not write oh it drives me halfmad to think of it and i cant sleep a wink at night she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it

i shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life

then you dont think ill see him again

i fear not

then what has happened to him

you will leave that question in my hands i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare

i advertised for him in last saturdays chronicle said she here is the slip and here are four letters from him

thank you and your address

no  lyon place camberwell

mr angels address you never had i understand where is your fathers place of business

he travels for westhouse  marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street

thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life

you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that i shall be true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back

for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned

sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloudwreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face

quite an interesting study that maiden he observed i found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in  and there was something of the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me but the maiden herself was most instructive

you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me i remarked

not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumbnails or the great issues that may hang from a bootlace now what did you gather from that womans appearance describe it

well she had a slatecoloured broadbrimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger her boots i didnt observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly welltodo in a vulgar comfortable easygoing way

sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled

 pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my first glance is always at a womans sleeve in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined the sewingmachine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pincenez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her

it surprised me

but surely it was obvious i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toecap and the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots halfbuttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry

and what else i asked keenly interested as i always was by my friends incisive reasoning

i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel

i held the little printed slip to the light

missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named hosmer angel about five ft seven in in height strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in the centre bushy black sidewhiskers and moustache tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech was dressed when last seen in black frockcoat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elasticsided boots known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street anybody bringing

that will do said holmes as to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace absolutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you

they are typewritten i remarked

not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestivein fact we may call it conclusive

of what

my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case

i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted

no that was not the point however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young ladys stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six oclock tomorrow evening it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim

i had had so many reasons to believe in my friends subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom once only had i known him to fail in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel

i left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland

a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer it was not until close upon six oclock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery i found sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair a formidable array of bottles and testtubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him

well have you solved it i asked as i entered

yes it was the bisulphate of baryta

no no the mystery i cried

oh that i thought of the salt that i have been working upon there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel

who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland

the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door

this is the girls stepfather mr james windibank said holmes he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in

the man who entered was a sturdy middlesized fellow some thirty years of age cleanshaven and sallowskinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes he shot a questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny tophat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair

goodevening mr james windibank said holmes i think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six oclock

yes sir i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel

on the contrary said holmes quietly i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel

mr windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves i am delighted to hear it he said

it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a mans handwriting unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious

we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes

and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study mr windibank holmes continued i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man they are all typewritten in each case not only are the es slurred and the rs tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well

mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes he said if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it

certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door i let you know then that i have caught him

what where shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap

oh it wont doreally it wont said holmes suavely there is no possible getting out of it mr windibank it is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question thats right sit down and let us talk it over

our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow itits not actionable he stammered

i am very much afraid that it is not but between ourselves windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong

the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us

the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them it was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference it was worth an effort to preserve it the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warmhearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age but soon he found that that would not answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball what does her clever stepfather do then he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girls short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself

it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor we never thought that she would have been so carried away

very likely not however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girls affections from turning towards anyone else but the deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a fourwheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of events mr windibank

our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face

it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me i have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint

the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders by jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the mans face it is not part of my duties to my client but heres a hunting crop handy and i think i shall just treat myself to he took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road

theres a coldblooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest

i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i remarked

well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction

and how did you verify them

having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration i knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed description i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguisethe whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects the same post brought me a letter from westhouse  marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe james windibank voila tout

and miss sutherland

if i tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world

adventure iv the boscombe valley mystery


we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the maid brought in a telegram it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way

have you a couple of days to spare have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy shall be glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect leave paddington by the 

what do you say dear said my wife looking across at me will you go

i really dont know what to say i have a fairly long list at present

oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking a little pale lately i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases

i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them i answered but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour

my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller my wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travellingcloak and closefitting cloth cap

it is really very good of you to come watson said he it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless or else biassed if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets

we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him among these he rummaged and read with intervals of notetaking and of meditation until we were past reading then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack

have you heard anything of the case he asked

not a word i have not seen a paper for some days

the london press has not had very full accounts i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult

that sounds a little paradoxical

but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man

it is a murder then

well it is conjectured to be so i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words

boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was also an exaustralian the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the racemeetings of the neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servantsa man and a girl turner had a considerable household some halfdozen at the least that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families now for the facts

on june rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley he had been out with his servingman in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three from that appointment he never came back alive

from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a gamekeeper in the employ of mr turner both these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone the gamekeeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred

the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the gamekeeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodgekeeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodgekeeper he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the buttend of his sons gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the policecourt

i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here

circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes thoughtfully it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home

i am afraid said i that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case

there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the righthand side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted even so selfevident a thing as that

how on earth

my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness which characterises you you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference therein lies my metier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering

what are they

it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroners jury

it was a confession i ejaculated

no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence

coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark

on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable selfrestraint and firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him the selfreproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one

i shook my head many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence i remarked

so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged

what is the young mans own account of the matter

it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself

he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this way

mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the rd my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william crowder the gamekeeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm i had not gone more than  yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr turners lodgekeeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies i know nothing further of the matter

the coroner did your father make any statement to you before he died

witness he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some allusion to a rat

the coroner what did you understand by that

witness it conveyed no meaning to me i thought that he was delirious

the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel

witness i should prefer not to answer

the coroner i am afraid that i must press it

witness it is really impossible for me to tell you i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed

the coroner that is for the court to decide i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise

witness i must still refuse

the coroner i understand that the cry of cooee was a common signal between you and your father

witness it was

the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol

witness with considerable confusion i do not know

a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured

witness nothing definite

the coroner what do you mean

witness i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me it seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone

 do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help

 yes it was gone

 you cannot say what it was

 no i had a feeling something was there

 how far from the body

 a dozen yards or so

 and how far from the edge of the wood

 about the same

 then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it

 yes but with my back towards it

this concluded the examination of the witness

i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his fathers dying words they are all as he remarks very much against the son

holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young mans favour dont you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes

it was nearly four oclock when we at last after passing through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn found ourselves at the pretty little countrytown of ross a lean ferretlike man furtive and slylooking was waiting for us upon the platform in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leatherleggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us

i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime

it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered it is entirely a question of barometric pressure

lestrade looked startled i do not quite follow he said

how is the glass twentynine i see no wind and not a cloud in the sky i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage tonight

lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes still of course one cant refuse a lady and such a very positive one too she has heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door

he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern

oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a womans quick intuition fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come i have driven down to tell you so i know that james didnt do it i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does but he is too tenderhearted to hurt a fly such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him

i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes you may rely upon my doing all that i can

but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself think that he is innocent

i think that it is very probable

there now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes

lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said

but he is right oh i know that he is right james never did it and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it

in what way asked holmes

it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet andandwell he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them

and your father asked holmes was he in favour of such a union

no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her

thank you for this information said he may i see your father if i call tomorrow

i am afraid the doctor wont allow it

the doctor

yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria

ha in victoria that is important

yes at the mines

quite so at the goldmines where as i understand mr turner made his money

yes certainly

thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to me

you will tell me if you have any news tomorrow no doubt you will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent

i will miss turner

i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him goodbye and god help you in your undertaking she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street

i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint i am not overtender of heart but i call it cruel

i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes have you an order to see him in prison

yes but only for you and me

then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him tonight

ample

then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours

i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellowbacked novel the puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day supposing that this unhappy young mans story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade it was something terrible and deadly what could it be might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest in the surgeons deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon i marked the spot upon my own head clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell still it might be worth while to call holmes attention to it then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat what could that mean it could not be delirium a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate but what could it indicate i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was i did not wonder at lestrades opinion and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthys innocence

it was late before sherlock holmes returned he came back alone for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town

the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey i have seen young mccarthy

and what did you learn from him

nothing

could he throw no light

none at all i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very quickwitted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart

i cannot admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner

ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boardingschool what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that point it is of importance good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered

but if he is innocent who has done it

ah who i would call your attention very particularly to two points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until tomorrow

there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless at nine oclock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool

there is serious news this morning lestrade observed it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of

an elderly man i presume said holmes

about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthys and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free

indeed that is interesting said holmes

oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him

really does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduce something from that

we have got to the deductions and the inferences said lestrade winking at me i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies

you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts

anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth

and that is

that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine

well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes laughing but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left

yes that is it it was a widespread comfortablelooking building twostoried slateroofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the sons though not the pair which he had then had having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool

sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool it was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow lestrade and i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end

the boscombe pool which is a little reedgirt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowners dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion

what did you go into the pool for he asked

i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon or other trace but how on earth

oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the lodgekeeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of the same feet he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us these are young mccarthys feet twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are the fathers feet as he paced up and down what is this then it is the buttend of the gun as the son stood listening and this ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite unusual boots they come they go they come againof course that was for the cloak now where did they come from he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad where all traces were lost

it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note having done that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently

it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood

this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out the murder was done with it

i see no marks

there are none

how do you know then

the grass was growing under it it had only lain there a few days there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken it corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other weapon

and the murderer

is a tall man lefthanded limps with the right leg wears thicksoled shootingboots and a grey cloak smokes indian cigars uses a cigarholder and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search

lestrade laughed i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he said theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hardheaded british jury

nous verrons answered holmes calmly you work your own method and i shall work mine i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the evening train

and leave your case unfinished

no finished

but the mystery

it is solved

who was the criminal then

the gentleman i describe

but who is he

surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a populous neighbourhood

lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am a practical man he said and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a lefthanded gentleman with a game leg i should become the laughingstock of scotland yard

all right said holmes quietly i have given you the chance here are your lodgings goodbye i shall drop you a line before i leave

having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position

look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little i dont know quite what to do and i should value your advice light a cigar and let me expound

pray do so

well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthys narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true

what of this cooee then

well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia

what of the rat then

sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table this is a map of the colony of victoria he said i wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand over part of the map what do you read

arat i read

and now he raised his hand

ballarat

quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat

it is wonderful i exclaimed

it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak

certainly

and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander

quite so

then comes our expedition of today by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal

but how did you gain them

you know my method it is founded upon the observation of trifles

his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces

yes they were peculiar boots

but his lameness

the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it why because he limpedhe was lame

but his lefthandedness

you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a lefthanded man he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son he had even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of  different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam

and the cigarholder

i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt penknife

holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him i see the direction in which all this points the culprit is

mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sittingroom and ushering in a visitor

the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deeplined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease

pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my note

yes the lodgekeeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal

i thought people would talk if i went to the hall

and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered

yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words it is so i know all about mccarthy

the old man sank his face in his hands god help me he cried but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes

i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely

i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heartit will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested

it may not come to that said holmes

what

i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests young mccarthy must be got off however

i am a dying man said old turner i have had diabetes for years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol

holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him just tell us the truth he said i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed

its as well said the old man its a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell

you didnt know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil incarnate i tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life ill tell you first how i came to be in his power

it was in the early s at the diggings i was a young chap then hotblooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang

one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of the wagondriver who was this very man mccarthy i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me

i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot

 here we are jack says he touching me on the arm well be as good as a family to you theres two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us if you dontits a fine lawabiding country is england and theres always a policeman within hail

well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give he asked for alice

his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property but there i was firm i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough i stood firm mccarthy threatened i braved him to do his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over

when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this could i not snap the bond i was already a dying and a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight that is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred

well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation

i pray not sir and what do you intend to do

in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us

farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room

god help us said holmes after a long silence why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxters words and say there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes 

james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past

adventure  v  the five orange pips


when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years  and  i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up

the year  furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which i retain the records among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the camberwell poisoning case in the latter as may be remembered sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead mans watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that timea deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe

it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great handmade london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace crossindexing his records of crime while i at the other was deep in one of clark russells fine seastories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves my wife was on a visit to her mothers and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street

why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell who could come tonight some friend of yours perhaps

except yourself i have none he answered i do not encourage visitors

a client then

if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landladys

sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit

come in said he

the man who entered was young some twoandtwenty at the outside wellgroomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety

i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pincenez to his eyes i trust that i am not intruding i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber

give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from the southwest i see

yes from horsham

that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive

i have come for advice

that is easily got

and help

that is not always so easy

i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal

ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards

he said that you could solve anything

he said too much

that you are never beaten

i have been beaten four timesthree times by men and once by a woman

but what is that compared with the number of your successes

it is true that i have been generally successful

then you may be so with me

i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case

it is no ordinary one

none of those which come to me are i am the last court of appeal

and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family

you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important

the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze

my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have as far as i can understand little to do with this awful business it is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the affair

you must know that my grandfather had two sonsmy uncle elias and my father joseph my father had a small factory at coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence

my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done very well at the time of the war he fought in jacksons army and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years about  or  he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them he was a singular man fierce and quicktempered very foulmouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition during all the years that he lived at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother

he didnt mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so this would be in the year  after he had been eight or nine years in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy there was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumberroom up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter with a boys curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room

one dayit was in march a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonels plate it was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort from india said he as he took it up pondicherry postmark what can this be opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate i began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand k k k he shrieked and then my god my god my sins have overtaken me

 what is it uncle i cried

 death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three times repeated there was nothing else save the five dried pips what could be the reason of his overpowering terror i left the breakfasttable and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other

 they may do what they like but ill checkmate them still said he with an oath tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room today and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer

i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it as i glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope

 i wish you john said my uncle to witness my will i leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you if you can enjoy it in peace well and good if you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy i am sorry to give you such a twoedged thing but i cant say what turn things are going to take kindly sign the paper where mr fordham shows you

i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him the singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives i could see a change in my uncle however he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul at such times i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin

well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little greenscummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some  which lay to his credit at the bank

one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide

the letter arrived on march   his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may nd

thank you pray proceed

when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and notebooks bearing upon my uncles life in america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpetbag politicians who had been sent down from the north

well it was the beginning of  when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of  on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfasttable there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what he called my cockandbull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself

 why what on earth does this mean john he stammered

my heart had turned to lead it is k k k said i

he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are the very letters but what is this written above them

 put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his shoulder

 what papers what sundial he asked

 the sundial in the garden there is no other said i but the papers must be those that are destroyed

 pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a civilised land here and we cant have tomfoolery of this kind where does the thing come from

 from dundee i answered glancing at the postmark

 some preposterous practical joke said he what have i to do with sundials and papers i shall take no notice of such nonsense

 i should certainly speak to the police i said

 and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort

 then let me do so

 no i forbid you i wont have a fuss made about such nonsense

it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man i went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings

on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home in that however i was in error upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once my father had fallen over one of the deep chalkpits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalkpit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that i was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him

in this sinister way i came into my inheritance you will ask me why i did not dispose of it i answer because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncles life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another

it was in january  that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father

the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips

this is the envelope he continued the postmark is londoneastern division within are the very words which were upon my fathers last message k k k and then put the papers on the sundial 

what have you done asked holmes

nothing

nothing

to tell the truthhe sank his face into his thin white handsi have felt helpless i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against

tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for despair

i have seen the police

ah

but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings

holmes shook his clenched hands in the air incredible imbecility he cried

they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me

has he come with you tonight

no his orders were to stay in the house

again holmes raved in the air

why did you come to me he cried and above all why did you not come at once

i did not know it was only today that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you

it is really two days since you had the letter we should have acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before usno suggestive detail which might help us

there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured bluetinted paper he laid it out upon the table i have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much i think myself that it is a page from some private diary the writing is undoubtedly my uncles

holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book it was headed march  and beneath were the following enigmatical notices

th hudson came same old platform

th set the pips on mccauley paramore and

        john swain of st augustine

th mccauley cleared

th john swain cleared

th visited paramore all well

thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me you must get home instantly and act

what shall i do

there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do you understand

entirely

do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties

i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat you have given me fresh life and hope i shall certainly do as you advise

do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you go back

by train from waterloo

it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely

i am armed

that is well tomorrow i shall set to work upon your case

i shall see you at horsham then

no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek it

then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers i shall take your advice in every particular he shook hands with us and took his leave outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elementsblown in upon us like a sheet of seaweed in a galeand now to have been reabsorbed by them once more

sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smokerings as they chased each other up to the ceiling

i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this

save perhaps the sign of four

well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos

but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are

there can be no question as to their nature he answered

then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family

sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his fingertips together the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion

yes i answered laughing it was a singular document philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember botany variable geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violinplayer boxer swordsman lawyer and selfpoisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the main points of my analysis

holmes grinned at the last item well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brainattic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us tonight we need certainly to muster all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the american encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those letters

the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london

from east london what do you deduce from that

they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship

excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest anything

a greater distance to travel

but the letter had also a greater distance to come

then i do not see the point

there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailingship it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mailboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer

it is possible

more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay

good god i cried what can it mean this relentless persecution

the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailingship i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society

but of what society

have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and sinking his voicehave you never heard of the ku klux klan

i never have

holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it is said he presently

 ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle this terrible secret society was formed by some exconfederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shapea sprig of oakleaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country if he braved the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south eventually in the year  the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date

you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered

then the page we have seen

is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent the pips to a b and cthat is sent the societys warning to them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done tonight so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men

it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down

you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he i have i foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaws

what steps will you take i asked

it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries i may have to go down to horsham after all

you will not go there first

no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee

as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart

holmes i cried you are too late

ah said he laying down his cup i feared as much how was it done he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved

my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy near waterloo bridge here is the account

 between nine and ten last night policeconstable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passersby it was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was given and by the aid of the waterpolice the body was eventually recovered it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river steamboats the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landingstages 

we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him

that hurts my pride watson he said at last it is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes a personal matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands

they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson we shall see who will win in the long run i am going out now

to the police

no i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before

all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street sherlock holmes had not come back yet it was nearly ten oclock before he entered looking pale and worn he walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of water

you are hungry i remarked

starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since breakfast

nothing

not a bite i had no time to think of it

and how have you succeeded

well

you have a clue

i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish trademark upon them it is well thought of

what do you mean

he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote s h for j o then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun barque lone star savannah georgia

that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling it may give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him

and who is this captain calhoun

the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first

how did you trace it then

he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names

i have spent the whole day said he over lloyds registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in  there were thirtysix ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months of these one the lone star instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union

texas i think

i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must have an american origin

what then

i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque lone star was there in january  my suspicion became a certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london

yes

the lone star had arrived here last week i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight

what will you do then

oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i learn the only nativeborn americans in the ship the others are finns and germans i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo by the time that their sailingship reaches savannah the mailboat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder

there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year we waited long for news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reached us we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered sternpost of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star

adventure  vi  the man with the twisted lip


isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney dd principal of the theological college of st georges was much addicted to opium the habit grew upon him as i understand from some foolish freak when he was at college for having read de quinceys description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects he found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives i can see him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pinpoint pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man

one nightit was in june there came a ring to my bell about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock i sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment

a patient said she youll have to go out

i groaned for i was newly come back from a weary day

we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum our own door flew open and a lady clad in some darkcoloured stuff with a black veil entered the room

you will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her selfcontrol she ran forward threw her arms about my wifes neck and sobbed upon her shoulder oh im in such trouble she cried i do so want a little help

why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney how you startled me kate i had not an idea who you were when you came in

i didnt know what to do so i came straight to you that was always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse

it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or should you rather that i sent james off to bed

oh no no i want the doctors advice and help too its about isa he has not been home for two days i am so frightened about him

it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husbands trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find did she know where her husband was was it possible that we could bring him back to her

it seems that it was she had the surest information that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had come back twitching and shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him eightandforty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him

there was the case and of course there was but one way out of it might i not escort her to this place and then as a second thought why should she come at all i was isa whitneys medical adviser and as such i had influence over him i could manage it better if i were alone i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sittingroom behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be

but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge between a slopshop and a ginshop approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave i found the den of which i was in search ordering my cab to wait i passed down the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the light of a flickering oillamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship

through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lacklustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a threelegged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon his knees staring into the fire

as i entered a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth

thank you i have not come to stay said i there is a friend of mine here mr isa whitney and i wish to speak with him

there was a movement and an exclamation from my right and peering through the gloom i saw whitney pale haggard and unkempt staring out at me

my god its watson said he he was in a pitiable state of reaction with every nerve in a twitter i say watson what oclock is it

nearly eleven

of what day

of friday june th

good heavens i thought it was wednesday it is wednesday what dyou want to frighten a chap for he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key

i tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself

so i am but youve got mixed watson for i have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipesi forget how many but ill go home with you i wouldnt frighten katepoor little kate give me your hand have you a cab

yes i have one waiting

then i shall go in it but i must owe something find what i owe watson i am all off colour i can do nothing for myself

i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt and a low voice whispered walk past me and then look back at me the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear i glanced down they could only have come from the old man at my side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers i took two steps forward and looked back it took all my selfcontrol to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment he had turned his back so that none could see him but i his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes he made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he turned his face half round to the company once more subsided into a doddering looselipped senility

holmes i whispered what on earth are you doing in this den

as low as you can he answered i have excellent ears if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you

i have a cab outside

then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait outside i shall be with you in five minutes

it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes requests for they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery i felt however that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished and for the rest i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence in a few minutes i had written my note paid whitneys bill led him out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter

i suppose watson said he that you imagine that i have added opiumsmoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views

i was certainly surprised to find you there

but not more so than i to find you

i came to find a friend

and i to find an enemy

an enemy

yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as i have done before now had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hours purchase for i have used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me there is a trapdoor at the back of that building near the corner of pauls wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights

what you do not mean bodies

ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had  for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den it is the vilest murdertrap on the whole riverside and i fear that neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more but our trap should be here he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrillya signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs

now watson said holmes as a tall dogcart dashed up through the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns youll come with me wont you

if i can be of use

oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so my room at the cedars is a doublebedded one

the cedars

yes that is mr st clairs house i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry

where is it then

near lee in kent we have a sevenmile drive before us

but i am all in the dark

of course you are youll know all about it presently jump up here all right john we shall not need you heres half a crown look out for me tomorrow about eleven give her her head so long then

he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which widened gradually until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while i sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts we had driven several miles and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best

you have a grand gift of silence watson said he it makes you quite invaluable as a companion pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not overpleasant i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman tonight when she meets me at the door

you forget that i know nothing about it

i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can get nothing to go upon theres plenty of thread no doubt but i cant get the end of it into my hand now ill state the case clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me

proceed then

some years agoto be definite in may there came to lee a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have plenty of money he took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood and in  he married the daughter of a local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the  from cannon street every night mr st clair is now thirtyseven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him i may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to  s while he has  standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank there is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind

last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up in your london you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where you found me tonight mrs st clair had her lunch started for the city did some shopping proceeded to the companys office got her packet and found herself at exactly  walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me so far

it is very clear

if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a secondfloor window the window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated he waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie

convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the stepsfor the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me tonightand running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor at the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare goodfortune met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat the inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no sign of him there in fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it out there fell a cascade of childrens bricks it was the toy which he had promised to bring home

this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime the front room was plainly furnished as a sittingroom and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of his coat his boots his socks his hat and his watchall were there there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st clair out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy

and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clairs story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husbands appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime his defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentlemans clothes

so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some little distance down threadneedle street upon the lefthand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat crosslegged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passersby this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest

but a cripple said i what could he have done singlehanded against a man in the prime of life

he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and wellnurtured man surely your medical experience would tell you watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others

pray continue your narrative

mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations inspector barton who had charge of the case made a very careful examination of the premises but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and searched without anything being found which could incriminate him there were it is true some bloodstains upon his right shirtsleeve but he pointed to his ringfinger which had been cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from there adding that he had been to the window not long before and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source he denied strenuously having ever seen mr neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police as to mrs st clairs assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming he was removed loudly protesting to the policestation while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue

and it did though they hardly found upon the mudbank what they had feared to find it was neville st clairs coat and not neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and what do you think they found in the pockets

i cannot imagine

no i dont think you would guess every pocket stuffed with pennies and halfpennies pennies and  halfpennies it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river

but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room would the body be dressed in a coat alone

no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed what would he do then it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the telltale garments he would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coats sinking he throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared

it certainly sounds feasible

well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him he had for years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solvedwhat neville st clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearanceare all as far from a solution as ever i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties

while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us just as he finished however we drove through two scattered villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows

we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion we have touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent see that light among the trees that is the cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have little doubt caught the clink of our horses feet

but why are you not conducting the case from baker street i asked

because there are many inquiries which must be made out here mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague i hate to meet her watson when i have no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa

we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds a stableboy had run out to the horses head and springing down i followed holmes up the small winding graveldrive which led to the house as we approached the door flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one halfraised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing question

well she cried well and then seeing that there were two of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders

no good news

none

no bad

no

thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have had a long day

this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation

i am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly you will i am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us

my dear madam said i i am an old campaigner and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed if i can be of any assistance either to you or to my friend here i shall be indeed happy

now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered a welllit diningroom upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions to which i beg that you will give a plain answer

certainly madam

do not trouble about my feelings i am not hysterical nor given to fainting i simply wish to hear your real real opinion

upon what point

in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive

sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basketchair

frankly then madam i do not

you think that he is dead

i do

murdered

i dont say that perhaps

and on what day did he meet his death

on monday

then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him today

sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised

what he roared

yes today she stood smiling holding up a little slip of paper in the air

may i see it

certainly

he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day before for it was considerably after midnight

coarse writing murmured holmes surely this is not your husbands writing madam

no but the enclosure is

i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address

how can you tell that

the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blottingpaper has been used if it had been written straight off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it it is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha there has been an enclosure here

yes there was a ring his signetring

and you are sure that this is your husbands hand

one of his hands

one

his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual writing and yet i know it well

 dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify wait in patienceneville written in pencil upon the flyleaf of a book octavo size no watermark hum posted today in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ha and the flap has been gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husbands hand madam

none neville wrote those words

and they were posted today at gravesend well mrs st clair the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the danger is over

but he must be alive mr holmes

unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent the ring after all proves nothing it may have been taken from him

no no it is it is his very own writing

very well it may however have been written on monday and only posted today

that is possible

if so much may have happened between

oh you must not discourage me mr holmes i know that all is well with him there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the diningroom rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death

i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you

i cannot imagine it is unthinkable

and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you

no

and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane

very much so

was the window open

yes

then he might have called to you

he might

he only as i understand gave an inarticulate cry

yes

a call for help you thought

yes he waved his hands

but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands

it is possible

and you thought he was pulled back

he disappeared so suddenly

he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the room

no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs

quite so your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on

but without his collar or tie i distinctly saw his bare throat

had he ever spoken of swandam lane

never

had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium

never

thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day tomorrow

a large and comfortable doublebedded room had been placed at our disposal and i was quickly between the sheets for i was weary after my night of adventure sherlock holmes was a man however who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days and even for a week without rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an allnight sitting he took off his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressinggown and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan upon which he perched himself crosslegged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there an old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent motionless with the light shining upon his strongset aquiline features so he sat as i dropped off to sleep and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment the pipe was still between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night

awake watson he asked

yes

game for a morning drive

certainly

then dress no one is stirring yet but i know where the stableboy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out he chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night

as i dressed i glanced at my watch it was no wonder that no one was stirring it was twentyfive minutes past four i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse

i want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his boots i think watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross but i think i have the key of the affair now

and where is it i asked smiling

in the bathroom he answered oh yes i am not joking he continued seeing my look of incredulity i have just been there and i have taken it out and i have got it in this gladstone bag come on my boy and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock

we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into the bright morning sunshine in the road stood our horse and trap with the halfclad stableboy waiting at the head we both sprang in and away we dashed down the london road a few country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream

it has been in some points a singular case said holmes flicking the horse on into a gallop i confess that i have been as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all

in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street sherlock holmes was well known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted him one of them held the horses head while the other led us in

who is on duty asked holmes

inspector bradstreet sir

ah bradstreet how are you a tall stout official had come down the stoneflagged passage in a peaked cap and frogged jacket i wish to have a quiet word with you bradstreet certainly mr holmes step into my room here it was a small officelike room with a huge ledger upon the table and a telephone projecting from the wall the inspector sat down at his desk

what can i do for you mr holmes

i called about that beggarman boonethe one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st clair of lee

yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries

so i heard you have him here

in the cells

is he quiet

oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel

dirty

yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinkers well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and i think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it

i should like to see him very much

would you that is easily done come this way you can leave your bag

no i think that ill take it

very good come this way if you please he led us down a passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side

the third on the right is his said the inspector here it is he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through

he is asleep said he you can see him very well

we both put our eyes to the grating the prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and heavily he was a middlesized man coarsely clad as became his calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat he was as the inspector had said extremely dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead

hes a beauty isnt he said the inspector

he certainly needs a wash remarked holmes i had an idea that he might and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a very large bathsponge

he he you are a funny one chuckled the inspector

now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure

well i dont know why not said the inspector he doesnt look a credit to the bow street cells does he he slipped his key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell the sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep slumber holmes stooped to the waterjug moistened his sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoners face

let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of lee in the county of kent

never in my life have i seen such a sight the mans face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree gone was the coarse brown tint gone too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face a twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sadfaced refinedlooking man blackhaired and smoothskinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow

great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man i know him from the photograph

the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny be it so said he and pray what am i charged with

with making away with mr neville st oh come you cant be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it said the inspector with a grin well i have been twentyseven years in the force but this really takes the cake

if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore i am illegally detained

no crime but a very great error has been committed said holmes you would have done better to have trusted you wife

it was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner god help me i would not have them ashamed of their father my god what an exposure what can i do

sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder

if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said he of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers inspector bradstreet would i am sure make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case would then never go into court at all

god bless you cried the prisoner passionately i would have endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children

you are the first who have ever heard my story my father was a schoolmaster in chesterfield where i received an excellent education i travelled in my youth took to the stage and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis and i volunteered to supply them there was the point from which all my adventures started it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles when an actor i had of course learned all the secrets of making up and had been famous in the greenroom for my skill i took advantage now of my attainments i painted my face and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of fleshcoloured plaster then with a red head of hair and an appropriate dress i took my station in the business part of the city ostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar for seven hours i plied my trade and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than s d

i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until some time later i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for  i was at my wits end where to get the money but a sudden idea came to me i begged a fortnights grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt

well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at  a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and sitting still it was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollars won at last and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers only one man knew my secret he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a welldressed man about town this fellow a lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession

well very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn  a yearwhich is less than my average takingsbut i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city all day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take 

as i grew richer i grew more ambitious took a house in the country and eventually married without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation my dear wife knew that i had business in the city she little knew what

last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes fixed full upon me i gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me i heard her voice downstairs but i knew that she could not ascend swiftly i threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig even a wifes eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that the clothes might betray me i threw open the window reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning then i seized my coat which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings i hurled it out of the window and it disappeared into the thames the other clothes would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair and a few minutes after i found rather i confess to my relief that instead of being identified as mr neville st clair i was arrested as his murderer

i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear

that note only reached her yesterday said holmes

good god what a week she must have spent

the police have watched this lascar said inspector bradstreet and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days

that was it said holmes nodding approvingly i have no doubt of it but have you never been prosecuted for begging

many times but what was a fine to me

it must stop here however said bradstreet if the police are to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone

i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take

in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out i am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your results

i reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag i think watson that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast

vii  the adventure of the blue carbuncle


i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning after christmas with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressinggown a piperack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hardfelt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several places a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination

you are engaged said i perhaps i interrupt you

not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results the matter is a perfectly trivial onehe jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hatbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction

i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals i suppose i remarked that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to itthat it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime

no no no crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal we have already had experience of such

so much so i remarked that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime

precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip well i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category you know peterson the commissionaire

yes

it is to him that this trophy belongs

it is his hat

no no he found it its owner is unknown i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of petersons fire the facts are these about four oclock on christmas morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an officiallooking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose

which surely he restored to their owner

my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials h b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them

what then did peterson do

he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner

did he not advertise

no

then what clue could you have as to his identity

only as much as we can deduce

from his hat

precisely

but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered felt

here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article

i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured there was no makers name but as holmes had remarked the initials h b were scrawled upon one side it was pierced in the brim for a hatsecurer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink

i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend

on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail however to reason from what you see you are too timid in drawing your inferences

then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat

he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly welltodo within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him

my dear holmes

he has however retained some degree of selfrespect he continued disregarding my remonstrance he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middleaged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with limecream these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house

you are certainly joking holmes

not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained

i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual

for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose it is a question of cubic capacity said he a man with so large a brain must have something in it

the decline of his fortunes then

this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge came in then it is a hat of the very best quality look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world

well that is clear enough certainly but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression

sherlock holmes laughed here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hatsecurer they are never sold upon hats if this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature on the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his selfrespect

your reasoning is certainly plausible

the further points that he is middleaged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses limecream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of hairends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of limecream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training

but his wifeyou said that she had ceased to love him

this hat has not been brushed for weeks when i see you my dear watson with a weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes affection

but he might be a bachelor

nay he was bringing home the goose as a peaceoffering to his wife remember the card upon the birds leg

you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house

one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never got tallowstains from a gasjet are you satisfied

well it is very ingenious said i laughing but since as you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy

sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment

the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped

eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the mans excited face

see here sir see what my wife found in its crop he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand

sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle by jove peterson said he this is treasure trove indeed i suppose you know what you have got

a diamond sir a precious stone it cuts into glass as though it were putty

its more than a precious stone it is the precious stone

not the countess of morcars blue carbuncle i ejaculated

precisely so i ought to know its size and shape seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in the times every day lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of  is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price

a thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us

that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem

it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i remarked

precisely so on december nd just five days ago john horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the ladys jewelcase the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes i have some account of the matter here i believe he rummaged amid his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the following paragraph

hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner  plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the nd inst abstracted from the jewelcase of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder upperattendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressingroom of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had remained with horner some little time but had finally been called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressingtable ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to the countess deposed to having heard ryders cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room where she found matters as described by the last witness inspector bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court

hum so much for the policecourt said holmes thoughtfully tossing aside the paper the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewelcase at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other you see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone the stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery to do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers if this fail i shall have recourse to other methods

what will you say

give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then found at the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr henry baker can have the same by applying at  this evening at b baker street that is clear and concise

very but will he see it

well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers

in which sir

oh in the globe star pall mall st jamess evening news standard echo and any others that occur to you

very well sir and this stone

ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring

when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and held it against the light its a bonny thing said he just see how it glints and sparkles of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime every good stone is they are the devils pet baits in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed this stone is not yet twenty years old it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red in spite of its youth it has already a sinister history there have been two murders a vitriolthrowing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this fortygrain weight of crystallised charcoal who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison ill lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it

do you think that this man horner is innocent

i cannot tell

well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter

it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold that however i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement

and you can do nothing until then

nothing

in that case i shall continue my professional round but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business

very glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop

i had been delayed at a case and it was a little after halfpast six when i found myself in baker street once more as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight just as i arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to holmes room

mr henry baker i believe said he rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume pray take this chair by the fire mr baker it is a cold night and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter ah watson you have just come at the right time is that your hat mr baker

yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat

he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his habits his rusty black frockcoat was buttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had illusage at the hands of fortune

we have retained these things for some days said holmes because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise

our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them

very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it

to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement

yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well

oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief

of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish

the man burst into a hearty laugh they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me no sir i think that with your permission i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard

sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders

there is your hat then and there your bird said he by the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from i am somewhat of a fowl fancier and i have seldom seen a better grown goose

certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn near the museumwe are to be found in the museum itself during the day you understand this year our good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at christmas my pence were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you i am much indebted to you sir for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way

so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the door behind him it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter are you hungry watson

not particularly

then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot

by all means

it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats outside the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passersby blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter wimpole street harley street and so through wigmore street into oxford street in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn which is a small publichouse at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddyfaced whiteaproned landlord

your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he

my geese the man seemed surprised

yes i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker who was a member of your goose club

ah yes i see but you see sir thems not our geese

indeed whose then

well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden

indeed i know some of them which was it

breckinridge is his name

ah i dont know him well heres your good health landlord and prosperity to your house goodnight

now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air remember watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands let us follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and quick march

we passed across holborn down endell street and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horseylooking man with a sharp face and trim sidewhiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters

goodevening its a cold night said holmes

the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion

sold out of geese i see continued holmes pointing at the bare slabs of marble

let you have five hundred tomorrow morning

thats no good

well there are some on the stall with the gasflare

ah but i was recommended to you

who by

the landlord of the alpha

oh yes i sent him a couple of dozen

fine birds they were too now where did you get them from

to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman

now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms akimbo what are you driving at lets have it straight now

it is straight enough i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha

well then i shant tell you so now

oh it is a matter of no importance but i dont know why you should be so warm over such a trifle

warm youd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business but its where are the geese and who did you sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over them

well i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries said holmes carelessly if you wont tell us the bet is off that is all but im always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred

well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred snapped the salesman

its nothing of the kind

i say it is

i dont believe it

dyou think you know more about fowls than i who have handled them ever since i was a nipper i tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred

youll never persuade me to believe that

will you bet then

its merely taking your money for i know that i am right but ill have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate

the salesman chuckled grimly bring me the books bill said he

the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasybacked one laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp

now then mr cocksure said the salesman i thought that i was out of geese but before i finish youll find that there is still one left in my shop you see this little book

well

thats the list of the folk from whom i buy dyou see well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger now then you see this other page in red ink well that is a list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just read it out to me

mrs oakshott  brixton road read holmes

quite so now turn that up in the ledger

holmes turned to the page indicated here you are mrs oakshott  brixton road egg and poultry supplier 

now then whats the last entry

 december nd twentyfour geese at s d 

quite so there you are and underneath

 sold to mr windigate of the alpha at s 

what have you to say now

sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words a few yards off he stopped under a lamppost and laughed in the hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him

when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet said he i daresay that if i had put  down in front of him that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager well watson we are i fancy nearing the end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott tonight or whether we should reserve it for tomorrow it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter and i should

his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left turning round we saw a little ratfaced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure

ive had enough of you and your geese he shouted i wish you were all at the devil together if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk ill set the dog at you you bring mrs oakshott here and ill answer her but what have you to do with it did i buy the geese off you

no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man

well then ask mrs oakshott for it

she told me to ask you

well you can ask the king of proosia for all i care ive had enough of it get out of this he rushed fiercely forward and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness

ha this may save us a visit to brixton road whispered holmes come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder he sprang round and i could see in the gaslight that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face

who are you then what do you want he asked in a quavering voice

you will excuse me said holmes blandly but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now i think that i could be of assistance to you

you who are you how could you know anything of the matter

my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other people dont know

but you can know nothing of this

excuse me i know everything of it you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr henry baker is a member

oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter

sherlock holmes hailed a fourwheeler which was passing in that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this windswept marketplace said he but pray tell me before we go farther who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting

the man hesitated for an instant my name is john robinson he answered with a sidelong glance

no no the real name said holmes sweetly it is always awkward doing business with an alias

a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger well then said he my real name is james ryder

precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know

the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with halffrightened halfhopeful eyes as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in the sittingroom at baker street nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him

here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold mr ryder pray take the basketchair i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then you want to know what became of those geese

yes sir

or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in which you were interestedwhite with a black bar across the tail

ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to

it came here

here

yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i dont wonder that you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was deadthe bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen i have it here in my museum

our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand holmes unlocked his strongbox and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant manypointed radiance ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it

the games up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or youll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair watson hes not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little more human what a shrimp it is to be sure

for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser

i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcars

it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice

i seeher ladyships waitingmaid well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you you knew that this man horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him what did you do then you made some small job in my ladys roomyou and your confederate cusackand you managed that he should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled the jewelcase raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested you then

ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companions knees for gods sake have mercy he shrieked think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts i never went wrong before i never will again i swear it ill swear it on a bible oh dont bring it into court for christs sake dont

get back into your chair said holmes sternly it is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing

i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the charge against him will break down

hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety

ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips i will tell you it just as it happened sir said he when horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe i went out as if on some commission and i made for my sisters house she had married a man named oakshott and lived in brixton road where she fattened fowls for the market all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road my sister asked me what was the matter and why i was so pale but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do

i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole i knew that he would be true to me for i knew one or two things about him so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence he would show me how to turn the stone into money but how to get to him in safety i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel i might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived

my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present and i knew that she was always as good as her word i would take my goose now and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn there was a little shed in the yard and behind this i drove one of the birdsa fine big one white with a barred tail i caught it and prying its bill open i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach the bird gave a gulp and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the matter as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others

 whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she

 well said i you said youd give me one for christmas and i was feeling which was the fattest

 oh says she weve set yours aside for youjems bird we call it its the big white one over yonder theres twentysix of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market

 thank you maggie says i but if it is all the same to you id rather have that one i was handling just now

 the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we fattened it expressly for you

 never mind ill have the other and ill take it now said i

 oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it you want then

 that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the flock

 oh very well kill it and take it with you

well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn i told my pal what i had done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to he laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose my heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred i left the bird rushed back to my sisters and hurried into the back yard there was not a bird to be seen there

 where are they all maggie i cried

 gone to the dealers jem

 which dealers

 breckinridge of covent garden

 but was there another with a barred tail i asked the same as the one i chose

 yes jem there were two barredtailed ones and i could never tell them apart

well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone you heard him yourselves tonight well he has always answered me like that my sister thinks that i am going mad sometimes i think that i am myself and nowand now i am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character god help me god help me he burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands

there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes fingertips upon the edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door

get out said he

what sir oh heaven bless you

no more words get out

and no more words were needed there was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street

after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his clay pipe i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must collapse i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just possible that i am saving a soul this fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and you make him a gaolbird for life besides it is the season of forgiveness chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature

viii  the adventure of the speckled band


on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the wellknown surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth

it was early in april in the year  that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarterpast seven i blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i was myself regular in my habits

very sorry to knock you up watson said he but its the common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you

what is it thena fire

no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sittingroom now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance

my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything

i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sittingroom a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered

goodmorning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering

it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested

what then

it is fear mr holmes it is terror she raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick allcomprehensive glances

you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt you have come in by train this morning i see

you know me then

no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart along heavy roads before you reached the station

the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion

there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dogcart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the lefthand side of the driver

whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn tonone save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful

holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small casebook which he consulted

farintosh said he ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter

alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me

i am all attention madam

my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey

holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he

the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west in the last century however four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the twohundredyearold house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice in a fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man

when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner the young widow of majorgeneral stoner of the bengal artillery my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old at the time of my mothers remarriage she had a considerable sum of moneynot less than  a yearand this she bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return to england my mother diedshe was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness

but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfathers case it had i believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics a series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the policecourt until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger

last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramblecovered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end he has a passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master

you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has

your sister is dead then

she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a halfpay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion

sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor

pray be precise as to details said he

it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manorhouse is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain

perfectly so

the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke she left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back

 tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night

 never said i

 i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep

 certainly not but why

 because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle i am a light sleeper and it has awakened me i cannot tell where it came fromperhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it

 no i have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation

 very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also

 ah but i sleep more heavily than you

 well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock

indeed said holmes was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night

always

and why

i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked

quite so pray proceed with your statement

i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sisters voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horrorstricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridorlamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressinggown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister

one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it

that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived

was your sister dressed

no she was in her nightdress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a matchbox

showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to

he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her

how about poison

the doctors examined her for it but without success

what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then

it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine

were there gipsies in the plantation at the time

yes there are nearly always some there

ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a banda speckled band

sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used

holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied

these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your narrative

two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitagepercy armitagethe second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dogcart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice

you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me all

yes all

miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather

why what do you mean

for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitors knee five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist

you have been cruelly used said holmes

the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength

there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire

this is a very deep business he said at last there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran today would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather

as it happens he spoke of coming into town today upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way

excellent you are not averse to this trip watson

by no means

then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself

i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming

and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast

no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room

and what do you think of it all watson asked sherlock holmes leaning back in his chair

it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business

dark enough and sinister enough

yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end

what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman

i cannot think

when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines

but what then did the gipsies do

i cannot imagine

i see many objections to any such theory

and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil

the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black tophat a long frockcoat and a pair of high gaiters with a huntingcrop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side a large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deepset bileshot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey

which of you is holmes asked this apparition

my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly

i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran

indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take a seat

i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you

it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes

what has she been saying to you screamed the old man furiously

but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably

ha you put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his huntingcrop i know you you scoundrel i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler

my friend smiled

holmes the busybody

his smile broadened

holmes the scotland yard jackinoffice

holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most entertaining said he when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught

i will go when i have said my say dont you dare to meddle with my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands

see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room

he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again

fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter

it was nearly one oclock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures

i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of  is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than  each daughter can claim an income of  in case of marriage it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket an eleys no  is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a toothbrush are i think all that we need

at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows

look there said he

a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high rooftree of a very old mansion

stoke moran said he

yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the driver

there is some building going on there said holmes that is where we are going

theres the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields there it is where the lady is walking

and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading his eyes yes i think we had better do as you suggest

we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead

i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business it may stop his gossip goodafternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word

our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy i have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening

we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened

good heavens she cried he has followed me then

so it appears

he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns

he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him tonight if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine

the building was of grey lichenblotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin the central portion was in little better repair but the righthand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stonework had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and down the illtrimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows

this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber

exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one

pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall

there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room

ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course

yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through

as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters

miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter

a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old countryhouses a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow whitecounterpaned bed in another and a dressingtable on the lefthand side of the window these articles with two small wickerwork chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown wormeaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment

where does that bell communicate with he asked at last pointing to a thick bellrope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow

it goes to the housekeepers room

it looks newer than the other things

yes it was only put there a couple of years ago

your sister asked for it i suppose

no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves

indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bellpull there you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with the woodwork with which the chamber was panelled finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the bellrope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug

why its a dummy said he

wont it ring

no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is

how very absurd i never noticed that before

very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope there are one or two very singular points about this room for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air

that is also quite modern said the lady

done about the same time as the bellrope remarked holmes

yes there were several little changes carried out about that time

they seem to have been of a most interesting characterdummy bellropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment

dr grimesby roylotts chamber was larger than that of his stepdaughter but was as plainly furnished a campbed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest

whats in here he asked tapping the safe

my stepfathers business papers

oh you have seen inside then

only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers

there isnt a cat in it for example

no what a strange idea

well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it

no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon

ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention

thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting

the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord

what do you make of that watson

its a common enough lash but i dont know why it should be tied

that is not quite so common is it ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn

i had never seen my friends face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie

it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect

i shall most certainly do so

the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance

i assure you that i am in your hands

in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room

both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment

yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there

yes that is the crown

very good your windows would be visible from there

certainly

you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night

oh yes easily

the rest you will leave in our hands

but what will you do

we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you

i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companions sleeve

perhaps i have

then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death

i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak

you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright

no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain goodbye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you

sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sittingroom at the crown inn they were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house at dusk we saw dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctors voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sittingrooms

do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you tonight there is a distinct element of danger

can i be of assistance

your presence might be invaluable

then i shall certainly come

it is very kind of you

you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me

no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine that you saw all that i did

i saw nothing remarkable save the bellrope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine

you saw the ventilator too

yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through

i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran

my dear holmes

oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry i deduced a ventilator

but what harm can there be in that

well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you

i cannot as yet see any connection

did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed

no

it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened like that before

i cannot say that i have

the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the ropeor so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bellpull

holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime

subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful

about nine oclock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the manor house two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us

that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window

as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand

there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness

my god i whispered did you see it

holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear

it is a nice household he murmured that is the baboon

i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected there was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes example and slipping off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words

the least sound would be fatal to our plans

i nodded to show that i had heard

we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator

i nodded again

do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair

i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table

holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness

how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil i could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat openeyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself the shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness

from outside came the occasional cry of a nightbird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall

suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal someone in the next room had lit a darklantern i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bellpull

you see it watson he yelled you see it

but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose

what can it mean i gasped

it means that it is all over holmes answered and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room

with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand

it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a darklantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion

the band the speckled band whispered holmes

i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent

it is a swamp adder cried holmes the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened

as he spoke he drew the dogwhip swiftly from the dead mans lap and throwing the noose round the reptiles neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arms length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it

such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day

i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bellrope which hung down to the bed the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage it would be a sharpeyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work then i thought of the whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim

i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it

with the result of driving it through the ventilator

and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylotts death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience

ix  the adventure of the engineers thumb


of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his noticethat of mr hatherleys thumb and that of colonel warburtons madness of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results the story has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single halfcolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect

it was in the summer of  not long after my marriage that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us my practice had steadily increased and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station i got a few patients from among the officials one of these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence

one morning at a little before seven oclock i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consultingroom i dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs as i descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him

ive got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder hes all right

what is it then i asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room

its a new patient he whispered i thought id bring him round myself then he couldnt slip away there he is all safe and sound i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him

i entered my consultingroom and found a gentleman seated by the table he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains he was young not more than fiveandtwenty i should say with a strong masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control

i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i have had a very serious accident during the night i came in by train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon the sidetable

i took it up and glanced at it mr victor hatherley hydraulic engineer a victoria street rd floor that was the name style and abode of my morning visitor i regret that i have kept you waiting said i sitting down in my librarychair you are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation

oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh

stop it i cried pull yourself together and i poured out some water from a caraffe

it was useless however he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very weary and palelooking

i have been making a fool of myself he gasped

not at all drink this i dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks

thats better said he and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be

he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots

good heavens i cried this is a terrible injury it must have bled considerably

yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time when i came to i found that it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig

excellent you should have been a surgeon

it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province

this has been done said i examining the wound by a very heavy and sharp instrument

a thing like a cleaver said he

an accident i presume

by no means

what a murderous attack

very murderous indeed

you horrify me

i sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages he lay back without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time

how is that i asked when i had finished

capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through

perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently trying to your nerves

oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done

ha cried i if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the official police

oh i have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of course i must use the official police as well would you give me an introduction to him

ill do better ill take you round to him myself

i should be immensely obliged to you

well call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it

yes i shall not feel easy until i have told my story

then my servant will call a cab and i shall be with you in an instant i rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance to baker street

sherlock holmes was as i expected lounging about his sittingroom in his dressinggown reading the agony column of the times and smoking his beforebreakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece he received us in his quietly genial fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach

it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one mr hatherley said he pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant

thank you said my patient but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences

holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavylidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while i sat opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us

you must know said he that i am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in london by profession i am a hydraulic engineer and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner  matheson the wellknown firm of greenwich two years ago having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor fathers death i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street

i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience to me it has been exceptionally so during two years i have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me my gross takings amount to  s every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon i waited in my little den until at last my heart began to sink and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all

yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business he brought up a card too with the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured he was plainly but neatly dressed and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than thirty

 mr hatherley said he with something of a german accent you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret

i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character

 well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london

 that is quite correct i answered but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me

 undoubtedly so but you will find that all i say is really to the point i have a professional commission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essentialabsolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family

 if i promise to keep a secret said i you may absolutely depend upon my doing so

he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye

 do you promise then said he at last

 yes i promise

 absolute and complete silence before during and after no reference to the matter at all either in word or writing

 i have already given you my word

 very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door the passage outside was empty

 thats all right said he coming back i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their masters affairs now we can talk in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look

a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience

 i beg that you will state your business sir said i my time is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips

 how would fifty guineas for a nights work suit you he asked

 most admirably

 i say a nights work but an hours would be nearer the mark i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves what do you think of such a commission as that

 the work appears to be light and the pay munificent

 precisely so we shall want you to come tonight by the last train

 where to

 to eyford in berkshire it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about 

 very good

 i shall come down in a carriage to meet you

 there is a drive then

 yes our little place is quite out in the country it is a good seven miles from eyford station

 then we can hardly get there before midnight i suppose there would be no chance of a train back i should be compelled to stop the night

 yes we could easily give you a shakedown

 that is very awkward could i not come at some more convenient hour

 we have judged it best that you should come late it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so

i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me not at all said i i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes i should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do

 quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers

 entirely

 then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that fullersearth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in england

 i have heard so

 some little time ago i bought a small placea very small placewithin ten miles of reading i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fullersearth in one of my fields on examining it however i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and leftboth of them however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a goldmine naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this i took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be goodbye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford tonight i hope that i make it all plain

 i quite follow you said i the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fullersearth which as i understand is dug out like gravel from a pit

 ah said he carelessly we have our own process we compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they are but that is a mere detail i have taken you fully into my confidence now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i trust you he rose as he spoke i shall expect you then at eyford at 

 i shall certainly be there

 and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room

well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me on the one hand of course i was glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones on the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me and i could not think that his explanation of the fullersearth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand however i threw all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue

at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i reached the little dimlit station after eleven oclock i was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern as i passed out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either side tapped on the woodwork and away we went as fast as the horse could go

one horse interjected holmes

yes only one

did you observe the colour

yes i saw it by the sidelights when i was stepping into the carriage it was a chestnut

tiredlooking or fresh

oh fresh and glossy

thank you i am sorry to have interrupted you pray continue your most interesting statement

away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but i should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve he sat at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than once when i glanced in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were but they were made of frosted glass and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged at last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a graveldrive and the carriage came to a stand colonel lysander stark sprang out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us we stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away

it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction it grew broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand

 perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes said he throwing open another door it was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door i shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness

i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science the others being volumes of poetry then i walked across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the countryside but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded across it it was a wonderfully silent house there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me who were these german people and what were they doing living in this strange outoftheway place and where was the place i was ten miles or so from eyford that was all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no idea for that matter reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country i paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea fee

suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open the woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her

 i would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to speak calmly i would go i should not stay here there is no good for you to do

 but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine

 it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can pass through the door no one hinders and then seeing that i smiled and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together for the love of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too late

but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way i thought of my fiftyguinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me was it all to go for nothing why should i slink away without having carried out my commission and without the payment which was my due this woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac with a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs she listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come

the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson

 this is my secretary and manager said the colonel by the way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now i fear that you have felt the draught

 on the contrary said i i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close

he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had better proceed to business then said he mr ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine

 i had better put my hat on i suppose

 oh no it is in the house

 what you dig fullersearth in the house

 no no this is only where we compress it but never mind that all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it

we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat manager and i behind him it was a labyrinth of an old house with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in green unhealthy blotches i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady even though i disregarded them and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellowcountryman

colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered me in

 we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you the machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right

i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very thoroughly it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure when i passed outside however and pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an examination showed that one of the indiarubber bands which was round the head of a drivingrod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked this was clearly the cause of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fullersearth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me

 what are you doing there he asked

i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me i was admiring your fullersearth said i i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used

the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes

 very well said he you shall know all about the machine he took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the lock i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves hullo i yelled hullo colonel let me out

and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder he had set the engine at work the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp i threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock i implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard rough surface then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap easier the other way perhaps and yet had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me already i was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart

i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the walls were of wood as i gave a last hurried glance around i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death the next instant i threw myself through and lay halffainting upon the other side the panel had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape

i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held a candle in her right it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected

 come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in a moment they will see that you are not there oh do not waste the soprecious time but come

this time at least i did not scorn her advice i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair the latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wits end then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly

 it is your only chance said she it is high but it may be that you can jump it

as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butchers cleaver in the other i rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down i clambered out upon the sill but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me if she were illused then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back

 fritz fritz she cried in english remember your promise after the last time you said it should not be again he will be silent oh he will be silent

 you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from her you will be the ruin of us he has seen too much let me pass i say he dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon i had let myself go and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell i was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the garden below

i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet suddenly however as i ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me i glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rosebushes

how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself my clothes were all sodden with dew and my coatsleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my nights adventure and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers but to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream

half dazed i went into the station and asked about the morning train there would be one to reading in less than an hour the same porter was on duty i found as had been there when i arrived i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark the name was strange to him had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me no he had not was there a policestation anywhere near there was one about three miles off

it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise

we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings

here is an advertisement which will interest you said he it appeared in all the papers about a year ago listen to this lost on the th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged twentysix a hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of since was dressed in etc etc ha that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy

good heavens cried my patient then that explains what the girl said

undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those outandout pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford

some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from reading to the little berkshire village there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector bradstreet of scotland yard a plainclothes man and myself bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre

there you are said he that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village the place we want must be somewhere near that line you said ten miles i think sir

it was an hours good drive

and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious

they must have done so i have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere

what i cannot understand said i is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden perhaps the villain was softened by the womans entreaties

i hardly think that likely i never saw a more inexorable face in my life

oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet well i have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found

i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly

really now cried the inspector you have formed your opinion come now we shall see who agrees with you i say it is south for the country is more deserted there

and i say east said my patient

i am for west remarked the plainclothes man there are several quiet little villages up there

and i am for north said i because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any

come cried the inspector laughing its a very pretty diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do you give your casting vote to

you are all wrong

but we cant all be

oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the centre of the circle this is where we shall find them

but the twelvemile drive gasped hatherley

six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads

indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet thoughtfully of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang

none at all said holmes they are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver

we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector they have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands but now thanks to this lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough

but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape

a house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way

yes sir said the stationmaster

when did it break out

i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze

whose house is it

dr bechers

tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very thin with a long sharp nose

the stationmaster laughed heartily no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isnt a man in the parish who has a betterlined waistcoat but he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm

the stationmaster had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire the road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in the garden in front three fireengines were vainly striving to keep the flames under

thats it cried hatherley in intense excitement there is the graveldrive and there are the rosebushes where i lay that second window is the one that i jumped from

well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon them there can be no question that it was your oillamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now

and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister german or the morose englishman early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts

the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an outhouse but no coins were to be found which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to

how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale he had evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones on the whole it was most probable that the silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger

well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to london it has been a pretty business for me i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fiftyguinea fee and what have i gained

experience said holmes laughing indirectly it may be of value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence

x  the adventure of the noble bachelor


the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this fouryearold drama as i have reason to believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode

it was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him i had remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence with my body in one easychair and my legs upon another i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last saturated with the news of the day i tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friends noble correspondent could be

here is a very fashionable epistle i remarked as he entered your morning letters if i remember right were from a fishmonger and a tidewaiter

yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie

he broke the seal and glanced over the contents

oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all

not social then

no distinctly professional

and from a noble client

one of the highest in england

my dear fellow i congratulate you

i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case it is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not

it looks like it said i ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in the corner i have had nothing else to do

it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his wedding

oh yes with the deepest interest

that is well the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st simon i will read it to you and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter this is what he says

 my dear mr sherlock holmeslord backwater tells me that i may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion i have determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding mr lestrade of scotland yard is acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no objection to your cooperation and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance i will call at four oclock in the afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that time i hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of paramount importance yours faithfully


 st simon

it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes as he folded up the epistle

he says four oclock it is three now he will be here in an hour

then i have just time with your assistance to get clear upon the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time while i take a glance as to who our client is he picked a redcovered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece here he is said he sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee  lord robert walsingham de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral hum arms azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable born in  hes fortyone years of age which is mature for marriage was undersecretary for the colonies in a late administration the duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive in all this i think that i must turn to you watson for something more solid

i have very little difficulty in finding what i want said i for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as remarkable i feared to refer them to you however as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters

oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van that is quite cleared up nowthough indeed it was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your newspaper selections

here is the first notice which i can find it is in the personal column of the morning post and dates as you see some weeks back a marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san francisco cal usa that is all

terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long thin legs towards the fire

there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week ah here it is there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present freetrade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little gods arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress 

anything else asked holmes yawning

oh yes plenty then there is another note in the morning post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at st georges hanover square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr aloysius doran two days laterthat is on wednesday lastthere is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwaters place near petersfield those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride

before the what asked holmes with a start

the vanishing of the lady

when did she vanish then

at the wedding breakfast

indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic in fact

yes it struck me as being a little out of the common

they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this pray let me have the details

i warn you that they are very incomplete

perhaps we may make them less so

such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday which i will read to you it is headed singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding

 the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding the ceremony as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation

 the ceremony which was performed at st georges hanover square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride 

and is that all

only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one

and it is

that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has actually been arrested it appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years there are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands nowso far as it has been set forth in the public press

and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be i would not have missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a witness if only as a check to my own memory

lord robert st simon announced our pageboy throwing open the door a gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face highnosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth and with the steady wellopened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed his manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked his hair too as he swept off his very curlybrimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top as to his dress it was careful to the verge of foppishness with high collar black frockcoat white waistcoat yellow gloves patentleather shoes and lightcoloured gaiters he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses

goodday lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing pray take the basketchair this is my friend and colleague dr watson draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over

a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine mr holmes i have been cut to the quick i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society

no i am descending

i beg pardon

my last client of the sort was a king

oh really i had no idea and which king

the king of scandinavia

what had he lost his wife

you can understand said holmes suavely that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours

of course very right very right im sure i beg pardon as to my own case i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion

thank you i have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more i presume that i may take it as correctthis article for example as to the disappearance of the bride

lord st simon glanced over it yes it is correct as far as it goes

but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you

pray do so

when did you first meet miss hatty doran

in san francisco a year ago

you were travelling in the states

yes

did you become engaged then

no

but you were on a friendly footing

i was amused by her society and she could see that i was amused

her father is very rich

he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope

and how did he make his money

in mining he had nothing a few years ago then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds

now what is your own impression as to the young ladysyour wifes character

the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire you see mr holmes said he my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of traditions she is impetuousvolcanic i was about to say she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions on the other hand i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bearhe gave a little stately coughhad i not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman i believe that she is capable of heroic selfsacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her

have you her photograph

i brought this with me he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman it was not a photograph but an ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the exquisite mouth holmes gazed long and earnestly at it then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon

the young lady came to london then and you renewed your acquaintance

yes her father brought her over for this last london season i met her several times became engaged to her and have now married her

she brought i understand a considerable dowry

a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family

and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait accompli

i really have made no inquiries on the subject

very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding

yes

was she in good spirits

never better she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives

indeed that is very interesting and on the morning of the wedding

she was as bright as possibleat least until after the ceremony

and did you observe any change in her then

well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case

pray let us have it for all that

oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew there was a moments delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall yet when i spoke to her of the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause

indeed you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of the general public were present then

oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open

this gentleman was not one of your wifes friends

no no i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a commonlooking person i hardly noticed his appearance but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point

lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do on reentering her fathers house

i saw her in conversation with her maid

and who is her maid

alice is her name she is an american and came from california with her

a confidential servant

a little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties still of course in america they look upon these things in a different way

how long did she speak to this alice

oh a few minutes i had something else to think of

you did not overhear what they said

lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was accustomed to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she meant

american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid

she walked into the breakfastroom

on your arm

no alone she was very independent in little matters like that then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she never came back

but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to her room covered her brides dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out

quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at mr dorans house that morning

ah yes i should like a few particulars as to this young lady and your relations to her

lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows we have been on a friendly footing for some yearsi may say on a very friendly footing she used to be at the allegro i have not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hotheaded and devotedly attached to me she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married and to tell the truth the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church she came to mr dorans door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and i had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row

did your wife hear all this

no thank goodness she did not

and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards

yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her

well it is a possible supposition

you think so too

i did not say a probable one but you do not yourself look upon this as likely

i do not think flora would hurt a fly

still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray what is your own theory as to what took place

well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one i have given you all the facts since you ask me however i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife

in short that she had become suddenly deranged

well really when i consider that she has turned her backi will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without successi can hardly explain it in any other fashion

well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said holmes smiling and now lord st simon i think that i have nearly all my data may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfasttable so that you could see out of the window

we could see the other side of the road and the park

quite so then i do not think that i need to detain you longer i shall communicate with you

should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our client rising

i have solved it

eh what was that

i say that i have solved it

where then is my wife

that is a detail which i shall speedily supply

lord st simon shook his head i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a stately oldfashioned manner he departed

it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own said sherlock holmes laughing i think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this crossquestioning i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room

my dear holmes

i have notes of several similar cases though none as i remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote thoreaus example

but i have heard all that you have heard

without however the knowledge of preexisting cases which serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the francoprussian war it is one of these casesbut hullo here is lestrade goodafternoon lestrade you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box

the official detective was attired in a peajacket and cravat which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him

whats up then asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye you look dissatisfied

and i feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage case i can make neither head nor tail of the business

really you surprise me

who ever heard of such a mixed affair every clue seems to slip through my fingers i have been at work upon it all day

and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the peajacket

yes i have been dragging the serpentine

in heavens name what for

in search of the body of lady st simon

sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily

have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain he asked

why what do you mean

because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other

lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion i suppose you know all about it he snarled

well i have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up

oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter

i think it very unlikely

then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the floor a weddingdress of watered silk a pair of white satin shoes and a brides wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked in water there said he putting a new weddingring upon the top of the pile there is a little nut for you to crack master holmes

oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air you dragged them from the serpentine

no they were found floating near the margin by a parkkeeper they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off

by the same brilliant reasoning every mans body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this

at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance

i am afraid that you will find it difficult

are you indeed now cried lestrade with some bitterness i am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences you have made two blunders in as many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar

and how

in the dress is a pocket in the pocket is a cardcase in the cardcase is a note and here is the very note he slapped it down upon the table in front of him listen to this you will see me when all is ready come at once f h m now my theory all along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance here signed with her initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach

very good lestrade said holmes laughing you really are very fine indeed let me see it he took up the paper in a listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction this is indeed important said he

ha you find it so

extremely so i congratulate you warmly

lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look why he shrieked youre looking at the wrong side

on the contrary this is the right side

the right side youre mad here is the note written in pencil over here

and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply

theres nothing in it i looked at it before said lestrade  oct th rooms s breakfast s d cocktail s lunch s d glass sherry d i see nothing in that

very likely not it is most important all the same as to the note it is important also or at least the initials are so i congratulate you again

ive wasted time enough said lestrade rising i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories goodday mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first he gathered up the garments thrust them into the bag and made for the door

just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival vanished i will tell you the true solution of the matter lady st simon is a myth there is not and there never has been any such person

lestrade looked sadly at my companion then he turned to me tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and hurried away

he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work he remarked so i think watson that i must leave you to your papers for a little

it was after five oclock when sherlock holmes left me but i had no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a confectioners man with a very large flat box this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodginghouse mahogany there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock a pheasant a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles having laid out all these luxuries my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address

just before nine oclock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room his features were gravely set but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions

they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands

you seem to expect company they have laid for five

yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in said he i am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs

it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features

my messenger reached you then asked holmes

yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure have you good authority for what you say

the best possible

lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead

what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation

it is the purest accident i cannot allow that there is any humiliation

ah you look on these things from another standpoint

i fail to see that anyone is to blame i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis

it was a slight sir a public slight said lord st simon tapping his fingers upon the table

you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position

i will make no allowance i am very angry indeed and i have been shamefully used

i think that i heard a ring said holmes yes there are steps on the landing if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter lord st simon i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman lord st simon said he allow me to introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton the lady i think you have already met

at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frockcoat a picture of offended dignity the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes it was as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist

youre angry robert said she well i guess you have every cause to be

pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly

oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went but i was kind of rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didnt know what i was doing or saying i only wonder i didnt fall down and do a faint right there before the altar

perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter

if i may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman weve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already for my part i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it he was a small wiry sunburnt man cleanshaven with a sharp face and alert manner

then ill tell our story right away said the lady frank here and i met in  in mcquires camp near the rockies where pa was working a claim we were engaged to each other frank and i but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa wouldnt hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to frisco frank wouldnt throw up his hand though so he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it it would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived why shouldnt we be married right away then said he and then i will feel sure of you and i wont claim to be your husband until i come back well we talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there and then frank went off to seek his fortune and i went back to pa

the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and then he went prospecting in arizona and then i heard of him from new mexico after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners camp had been attacked by apache indians and there was my franks name among the killed i fainted dead away and i was very sick for months after pa thought i had a decline and took me to half the doctors in frisco not a word of news came for a year and more so that i never doubted that frank was really dead then lord st simon came to frisco and we came to london and a marriage was arranged and pa was very pleased but i felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank

still if i had married lord st simon of course id have done my duty by him we cant command our love but we can our actions i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be but you may imagine what i felt when just as i came to the altar rails i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew i thought it was his ghost at first but when i looked again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him i wonder i didnt drop i know that everything was turning round and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear i didnt know what to do should i stop the service and make a scene in the church i glanced at him again and he seemed to know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper and i knew that he was writing me a note as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him and i determined to do just whatever he might direct

when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california and had always been his friend i ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready i know i ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards i hadnt been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park i slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman came talking something or other about lord st simon to meseemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage alsobut i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding

i saw it in a paper explained the american it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived

then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them againjust sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back so frank took my weddingclothes and things and made a bundle of them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we should have gone on to paris tomorrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me

lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative

excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner

then you wont forgive me you wont shake hands before i go

oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him

i had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us in a friendly supper

i think that there you ask a little too much responded his lordship i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very goodnight he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room

then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company said sherlock holmes it is always a joy to meet an american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in fargone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same worldwide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes

the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr lestrade of scotland yard

you were not yourself at fault at all then

from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she seen someone then if she had it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an american then who could this american be and why should he possess so much influence over her it might be a lover it might be a husband her young womanhood had i knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions so far i had got before i ever heard lord st simons narrative when he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the brides manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very significant allusion to claimjumpingwhich in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim tothe whole situation became absolutely clear she had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husbandthe chances being in favour of the latter

and how in the world did you find them

it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know the initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels

how did you deduce the select

by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded to  gordon square so thither i travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home i ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in particular i invited them to meet him here and as you see i made him keep the appointment

but with no very good result i remarked his conduct was certainly not very gracious

ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune i think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings

xi  the adventure of the beryl coronet


holmes said i as i stood one morning in our bowwindow looking down the street here is a madman coming along it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone

my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressinggown looking over my shoulder it was a bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the wintry sun down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and on the heapedup edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer passengers than usual indeed from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention

he was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frockcoat shining hat neat brown gaiters and wellcut pearlgrey trousers yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features for he was running hard with occasional little springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs as he ran he jerked his hands up and down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions

what on earth can be the matter with him i asked he is looking up at the numbers of the houses

i believe that he is coming here said holmes rubbing his hands

here

yes i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally i think that i recognise the symptoms ha did i not tell you as he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging

a few moments later he was in our room still puffing still gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity for a while he could not get his words out but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easychair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ

you have come to me to tell your story have you not said he you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have recovered yourself and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me

the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting against his emotion then he passed his handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us

no doubt you think me mad said he

i see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes

god knows i havea trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace i might have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain private affliction also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not i alone the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair

pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you

my name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your ears i am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder  stevenson of threadneedle street

the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london what could have happened then to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass we waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story

i feel that time is of value said he that is why i hastened here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your cooperation i came to baker street by the underground and hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this snow that is why i was so out of breath for i am a man who takes very little exercise i feel better now and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can

it is of course well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security is unimpeachable we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures libraries or plate

yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks i started when i saw the name for it was that of none other thanwell perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earthone of the highest noblest most exalted names in england i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task

 mr holder said he i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money

 the firm does so when the security is good i answered

 it is absolutely essential to me said he that i should have  at once i could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends but i much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place ones self under obligations

 for how long may i ask do you want this sum i asked

 next monday i have a large sum due to me and i shall then most certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you think it right to charge but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once

 i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse said i were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear if on the other hand i am to do it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner i must insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution should be taken

 i should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet

 one of the most precious public possessions of the empire said i

 precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft fleshcoloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named there are thirtynine enormous beryls said he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked i am prepared to leave it with you as my security

i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client

 you doubt its value he asked

 not at all i only doubt

 the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest about that i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it it is a pure matter of form is the security sufficient

 ample

 you understand mr holder that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you founded upon all that i have heard of you i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall call for it in person on monday morning

seeing that my client was anxious to leave i said no more but calling for my cashier i ordered him to pay over fifty  notes when i was alone once more however with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me there could be no doubt that as it was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it however it was too late to alter the matter now so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work

when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me bankers safes had been forced before now and why should not mine be if so how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself i determined therefore that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of my reach with this intention i called a cab and drove out to my house at streatham carrying the jewel with me i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressingroom

and now a word as to my household mr holmes for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation my groom and my page sleep out of the house and may be set aside altogether i have three maidservants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion another lucy parr the second waitingmaid has only been in my service a few months she came with an excellent character however and has always given me satisfaction she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way

so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it i am a widower and have an only son arthur he has been a disappointment to me mr holmesa grievous disappointment i have no doubt that i am myself to blame people tell me that i have spoiled him very likely i have when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face i have never denied him a wish perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i meant it for the best

it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn he was wild wayward and to speak the truth i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club and there having charming manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance that he might settle his debts of honour he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir george burnwell was enough to draw him back again

and indeed i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently brought him to my house and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner he is older than arthur a man of the world to his fingertips one who had been everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of great personal beauty yet when i think of him in cold blood far away from the glamour of his presence i am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted so i think and so too thinks my little mary who has a womans quick insight into character

and now there is only she to be described she is my niece but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter she is a sunbeam in my housesweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be she is my right hand i do not know what i could do without her in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas it is too lateforever too late

now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof and i shall continue with my miserable story

when we were taking coffee in the drawingroom that night after dinner i told arthur and mary my experience and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name of my client lucy parr who had brought in the coffee had i am sure left the room but i cannot swear that the door was closed mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet but i thought it better not to disturb it

 where have you put it asked arthur

 in my own bureau

 well i hope to goodness the house wont be burgled during the night said he

 it is locked up i answered

 oh any old key will fit that bureau when i was a youngster i have opened it myself with the key of the boxroom cupboard

he often had a wild way of talking so that i thought little of what he said he followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face

 look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let me have 

 no i cannot i answered sharply i have been far too generous with you in money matters

 you have been very kind said he but i must have this money or else i can never show my face inside the club again

 and a very good thing too i cried

 yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man said he i could not bear the disgrace i must raise the money in some way and if you will not let me have it then i must try other means

i was very angry for this was the third demand during the month you shall not have a farthing from me i cried on which he bowed and left the room without another word

when he was gone i unlocked my bureau made sure that my treasure was safe and locked it again then i started to go round the house to see that all was securea duty which i usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform myself that night as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as i approached

 tell me dad said she looking i thought a little disturbed did you give lucy the maid leave to go out tonight

 certainly not

 she came in just now by the back door i have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone but i think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped

 you must speak to her in the morning or i will if you prefer it are you sure that everything is fastened

 quite sure dad

 then goodnight i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again where i was soon asleep

i am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may have any bearing upon the case but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear

on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid

i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so i am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual about two in the morning then i was awakened by some sound in the house it had ceased ere i was wide awake but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere i lay listening with all my ears suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room i slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear and peeped round the corner of my dressingroom door

 arthur i screamed you villain you thief how dare you touch that coronet

the gas was half up as i had left it and my unhappy boy dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the light holding the coronet in his hands he appeared to be wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death i snatched it up and examined it one of the gold corners with three of the beryls in it was missing

 you blackguard i shouted beside myself with rage you have destroyed it you have dishonoured me forever where are the jewels which you have stolen

 stolen he cried

 yes thief i roared shaking him by the shoulder

 there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he

 there are three missing and you know where they are must i call you a liar as well as a thief did i not see you trying to tear off another piece

 you have called me names enough said he i will not stand it any longer i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world

 you shall leave it in the hands of the police i cried halfmad with grief and rage i shall have this matter probed to the bottom

 you shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion such as i should not have thought was in his nature if you choose to call the police let the police find what they can

by this time the whole house was astir for i had raised my voice in my anger mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of arthurs face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground i sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once when the inspector and a constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was national property i was determined that the law should have its way in everything

 at least said he you will not have me arrested at once it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes

 that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen said i and then realising the dreadful position in which i was placed i implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at stake and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones

 you may as well face the matter said i you have been caught in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous if you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten

 keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered turning away from me with a sneer i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him there was but one way for it i called in the inspector and gave him into custody a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats this morning he was removed to a cell and i after going through all the police formalities have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it you may go to any expense which you think necessary i have already offered a reward of  my god what shall i do i have lost my honour my gems and my son in one night oh what shall i do

he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words

sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire

do you receive much company he asked

none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthurs sir george burnwell has been several times lately no one else i think

do you go out much in society

arthur does mary and i stay at home we neither of us care for it

that is unusual in a young girl

she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she is fourandtwenty

this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also

terrible she is even more affected than i

you have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt

how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands

i hardly consider that a conclusive proof was the remainder of the coronet at all injured

yes it was twisted

do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it

god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me but it is too heavy a task what was he doing there at all if his purpose were innocent why did he not say so

precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several singular points about the case what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep

they considered that it might be caused by arthurs closing his bedroom door

a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems

they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them

have they thought of looking outside the house

yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has already been minutely examined

now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think it appeared to you to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex consider what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressingroom opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirtynine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirtysix into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered i ask you now is such a theory tenable

but what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of despair if his motives were innocent why does he not explain them

it is our task to find that out replied holmes so now if you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details

my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which i was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened i confess that the guilt of the bankers son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still i had such faith in holmes judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest residence of the great financier

fairbank was a goodsized square house of white stone standing back a little from the road a double carriagesweep with a snowclad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance on the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmens entrance on the left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmens path and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane so long was he that mr holder and i went into the diningroom and waited by the fire until he should return we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in she was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a womans face her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for selfrestraint disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress

you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked

no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom

but i am so sure that he is innocent you know what womans instincts are i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly

why is he silent then if he is innocent

who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him

how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand

oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison

i shall never let it drop until the gems are foundnever mary your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it

this gentleman she asked facing round to me

no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in the stable lane now

the stable lane she raised her dark eyebrows what can he hope to find there ah this i suppose is he i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime

i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder might i ask you a question or two

pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up

you heard nothing yourself last night

nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly i heard that and i came down

you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you fasten all the windows

yes

were they all fastened this morning

yes

you have a maid who has a sweetheart i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him

yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawingroom and who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet

i see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery

but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker impatiently when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands

wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door i presume

yes when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in i saw the man too in the gloom

do you know him

oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round his name is francis prosper

he stood said holmes to the left of the doorthat is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door

yes he did

and he is a man with a wooden leg

something like fear sprang up in the young ladys expressive black eyes why you are like a magician said she how do you know that she smiled but there was no answering smile in holmes thin eager face

i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up

he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens now we shall go upstairs said he at last

the bankers dressingroom was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock

which key was used to open it he asked

that which my son himself indicatedthat of the cupboard of the lumberroom

have you it here

that is it on the dressingtable

sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau

it is a noiseless lock said he it is no wonder that it did not wake you this case i presume contains the coronet we must have a look at it he opened the case and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table it was a magnificent specimen of the jewellers art and the thirtysix stones were the finest that i have ever seen at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge where a corner holding three gems had been torn away

now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost might i beg that you will break it off

the banker recoiled in horror i should not dream of trying said he

then i will holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but without result i feel it give a little said he but though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do you think would happen if i did break it mr holder there would be a noise like a pistol shot do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it

i do not know what to think it is all dark to me

but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think miss holder

i confess that i still share my uncles perplexity

your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him

he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt

thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your permission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations outside

he went alone at his own request for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult for an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever

i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr holder said he i can serve you best by returning to my rooms

but the gems mr holmes where are they

i cannot tell

the banker wrung his hands i shall never see them again he cried and my son you give me hopes

my opinion is in no way altered

then for gods sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night

if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms tomorrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer i understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw

i would give my fortune to have them back

very good i shall look into the matter between this and then goodbye it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening

it was obvious to me that my companions mind was now made up about the case although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always glided away to some other topic until at last i gave it over in despair it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer with his collar turned up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he was a perfect sample of the class

i think that this should do said he glancing into the glass above the fireplace i only wish that you could come with me watson but i fear that it wont do i may be on the trail in this matter or i may be following a willothewisp but i shall soon know which it is i hope that i may be back in a few hours he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition

i had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in excellent spirits swinging an old elasticsided boot in his hand he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea

i only looked in as i passed said he i am going right on

where to

oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time before i get back dont wait up for me in case i should be late

how are you getting on

oh so so nothing to complain of i have been out to streatham since i saw you last but i did not call at the house it is a very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a good deal however i must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self

i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply his eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks he hastened upstairs and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt

i waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so i retired to my room it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that his lateness caused me no surprise i do not know at what hour he came in but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other as fresh and trim as possible

you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning

why it is after nine now i answered i should not be surprised if that were he i thought i heard a ring

it was indeed our friend the financier i was shocked by the change which had come over him for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for him

i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried said he only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man without a care in the world now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another my niece mary has deserted me

deserted you

yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table i had said to her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so it is to that remark that she refers in this note

 my dearest unclei feel that i have brought trouble upon you and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred i cannot with this thought in my mind ever again be happy under your roof and i feel that i must leave you forever do not worry about my future for that is provided for and above all do not search for me for it will be fruitless labour and an illservice to me in life or in death i am ever your loving


 mary

what could she mean by that note mr holmes do you think it points to suicide

no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible solution i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles

ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have learned something where are the gems

you would not think  apiece an excessive sum for them

i would pay ten

that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter and there is a little reward i fancy have you your checkbook here is a pen better make it out for 

with a dazed face the banker made out the required check holmes walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table

with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up

you have it he gasped i am saved i am saved

the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom

there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock holmes rather sternly

owe he caught up a pen name the sum and i will pay it

no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to have one

then it was not arthur who took them

i told you yesterday and i repeat today that it was not

you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known

he knows it already when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me your news of this morning however may open his lips

for heavens sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery

i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now fled together

my mary impossible

it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most dangerous men in englanda ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening

i cannot and i will not believe it cried the banker with an ashen face

i will tell you then what occurred in your house last night your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane his footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the coronet his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he bent her to his will i have no doubt that she loved you but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and i think that she must have been one she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants escapade with her woodenlegged lover which was all perfectly true

your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressingroom petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passagelamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands she passed down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath he saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain

as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how allimportant it was to set it right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene

is it possible gasped the banker

you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret

and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet cried mr holder oh my god what a blind fool i have been and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle how cruelly i have misjudged him

when i arrived at the house continued holmes i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me i knew that none had fallen since the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions i passed along the tradesmens path but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg i could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while woodenleg had waited a little and then had gone away i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks which i took to be the police but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me

there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son the first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed after the other i followed them up and found they led to the hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting then i walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane i saw where boots had faced round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that i was not mistaken boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt when he came to the highroad at the other end i found that the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue

on entering the house however i examined as you remember the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and i could at once see that someone had passed out i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred a man had waited outside the window someone had brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected he had returned with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent so far i was clear the question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet

it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids but if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place there could be no possible reason as he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secretthe more so as the secret was a disgraceful one when i remembered that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a certainty

and who could it be who was her confederate a lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you i knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very limited one but among them was sir george burnwell i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems even though he knew that arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family

well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir georges house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his castoff shoes with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks

i saw an illdressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said mr holder

precisely it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes it was a delicate part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter i went and saw him at first of course he denied everything but when i gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver from the wall i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike then he became a little more reasonable i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held apiece that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why dash it all said he ive let them go at six hundred for the three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off i set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at  apiece then i looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock after what i may call a really hard days work

a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said the banker rising sir i cannot find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now

i think that we may safely say returned holmes that she is wherever sir george burnwell is it is equally certain too that whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment

xii  the adventure of the copper beeches


to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province

and yet said i smiling i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records

you have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative moodyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing

it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter i remarked with some coldness for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friends singular character

no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his wont my thoughts rather than my words if i claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thinga thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales

it was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street a thick fog rolled down between the lines of duncoloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings

at the same time he remarked after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense at all the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial

the end may have been so i answered but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest

pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial i cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boardingschools i think that i have touched bottom at last however this note i had this morning marks my zeropoint i fancy read it he tossed a crumpled letter across to me

it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening and ran thus

dear mr holmesi am very anxious to consult you as to whether i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess i shall call at halfpast ten tomorrow if i do not inconvenience you yours faithfully


violet hunter

do you know the young lady i asked

not i

it is halfpast ten now

yes and i have no doubt that is her ring

it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation it may be so in this case also

well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question

as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room she was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face freckled like a plovers egg and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world

you will excuse my troubling you i am sure said she as my companion rose to greet her but i have had a very strange experience and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do

pray take a seat miss hunter i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you

i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client he looked her over in his searching fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his fingertips together to listen to her story

i have been a governess for five years said she in the family of colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his children over to america with him so that i found myself without a situation i advertised and i answered advertisements but without success at last the little money which i had saved began to run short and i was at my wits end as to what i should do

there is a wellknown agency for governesses in the west end called westaways and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is really managed by miss stoper she sits in her own little office and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them

well when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual but i found that miss stoper was not alone a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper

 that will do said he i could not ask for anything better capital capital he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion he was such a comfortablelooking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him

 you are looking for a situation miss he asked

 yes sir

 as governess

 yes sir

 and what salary do you ask

 i had  a month in my last place with colonel spence munro

 oh tut tut sweatingrank sweating he cried throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments

 my accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said i a little french a little german music and drawing

 tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady there it is in a nutshell if you have not you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country but if you have why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures your salary with me madam would commence at  a year

you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as i was such an offer seemed almost too good to be true the gentleman however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face opened a pocketbook and took out a note

 it is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe

it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man as i was already in debt to my tradesmen the advance was a great convenience and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself

 may i ask where you live sir said i

 hampshire charming rural place the copper beeches five miles on the far side of winchester it is the most lovely country my dear young lady and the dearest old countryhouse

 and my duties sir i should be glad to know what they would be

 one childone dear little romper just six years old oh if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper smack smack smack three gone before you could wink he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again

i was a little startled at the nature of the childs amusement but the fathers laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking

 my sole duties then i asked are to take charge of a single child

 no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he cried your duty would be as i am sure your good sense would suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey you see no difficulty heh

 i should be happy to make myself useful

 quite so in dress now for example we are faddy people you knowfaddy but kindhearted if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you you would not object to our little whim heh

 no said i considerably astonished at his words

 or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to you

 oh no

 or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us

i could hardly believe my ears as you may observe mr holmes my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut it has been considered artistic i could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion

 i am afraid that that is quite impossible said i he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke

 i am afraid that it is quite essential said he it is a little fancy of my wifes and ladies fancies you know madam ladies fancies must be consulted and so you wont cut your hair

 no sir i really could not i answered firmly

 ah very well then that quite settles the matter it is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely in that case miss stoper i had best inspect a few more of your young ladies

the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal

 do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked

 if you please miss stoper

 well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you goodday to you miss hunter she struck a gong upon the table and i was shown out by the page

well mr holmes when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the table i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing after all if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity very few governesses in england are getting  a year besides what use was my hair to me many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake and by the day after i was sure of it i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself i have it here and i will read it to you


 the copper beeches near winchester

 dear miss huntermiss stoper has very kindly given me your address and i write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision my wife is very anxious that you should come for she has been much attracted by my description of you we are willing to give  a quarter or  a year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you they are not very exacting after all my wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning you need not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one belonging to my dear daughter alice now in philadelphia which would i should think fit you very well then as to sitting here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that need cause you no inconvenience as regards your hair it is no doubt a pity especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this point and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss your duties as far as the child is concerned are very light now do try to come and i shall meet you with the dogcart at winchester let me know your train yours faithfully


 jephro rucastle

that is the letter which i have just received mr holmes and my mind is made up that i will accept it i thought however that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration

well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question said holmes smiling

but you would not advise me to refuse

i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for

what is the meaning of it all mr holmes

ah i have no data i cannot tell perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion

well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr rucastle seemed to be a very kind goodnatured man is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak

that is a possible solutionin fact as matters stand it is the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady

but the money mr holmes the money

well yes of course the pay is goodtoo good that is what makes me uneasy why should they give you  a year when they could have their pick for  there must be some strong reason behind

i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me

oh you may carry that feeling away with you i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel about some of the features if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger

danger what danger do you foresee

holmes shook his head gravely it would cease to be a danger if we could define it said he but at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help

that is enough she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now i shall write to mr rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair tonight and start for winchester tomorrow with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both goodnight and bustled off upon her way

at least said i as we heard her quick firm steps descending the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself

and she would need to be said holmes gravely i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past

it was not very long before my friends prediction was fulfilled a fortnight went by during which i frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange sidealley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into the unusual salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond my powers to determine as to holmes i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it data data data he cried impatiently i cant make bricks without clay and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation

the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those allnight chemical researches which he frequently indulged in when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a testtube at night and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning he opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the message threw it across to me

just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back to his chemical studies

the summons was a brief and urgent one

please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday tomorrow it said do come i am at my wits end


hunter

will you come with me asked holmes glancing up

i should wish to

just look it up then

there is a train at halfpast nine said i glancing over my bradshaw it is due at winchester at 

that will do very nicely then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning

by eleven oclock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery it was an ideal spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east the sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a mans energy all over the countryside away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and grey roofs of the farmsteadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage

are they not fresh and beautiful i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street

but holmes shook his head gravely

do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject you look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty i look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there

good heavens i cried who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads

they always fill me with a certain horror it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside

you horrify me

but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i should never have had a fear for her it is the five miles of country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is not personally threatened

no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away

quite so she has her freedom

what can be the matter then can you suggest no explanation

i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell

the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us she had engaged a sittingroom and our lunch awaited us upon the table

i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly it is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me

pray tell us what has happened to you

i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr rucastle to be back before three i got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose

let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen

in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual illtreatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is only fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and i am not easy in my mind about them

what can you not understand

their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just as it occurred when i came down mr rucastle met me here and drove me in his dogcart to the copper beeches it is as he said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather there are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton highroad which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door this ground in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of lord southertons preserves a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place

i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street mrs rucastle is not mad i found her to be a silent palefaced woman much younger than her husband not more than thirty i should think while he can hardly be less than fortyfive from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother as the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her fathers young wife

mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse she was a nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face more than once i have surprised her in tears i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature he is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects but i would rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story

i am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they seem to you to be relevant or not

i shall try not to miss anything of importance the one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants there are only two a man and his wife toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual smell of drink twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable they are a most unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building

for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband

 oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance we shall now see how the electricblue dress will become you you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged

the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue it was of excellent material a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it both mr and mrs rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence they were waiting for me in the drawingroom which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor a chair had been placed close to the central window with its back turned towards it in this i was asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to you cannot imagine how comical he was and i laughed until i was quite weary mrs rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery

two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances again i changed my dress again i sat in the window and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire and which he told inimitably then he handed me a yellowbacked novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him i read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress

you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be they were always very careful i observed to turn my face away from the window so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back at first it seemed to be impossible but i soon devised a means my handmirror had been broken so a happy thought seized me and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief on the next occasion in the midst of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me i confess that i was disappointed there was nothing at least that was my first impression at the second glance however i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in my direction the road is an important highway and there are usually people there this man however was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze she said nothing but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me she rose at once

 jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter

 no friend of yours miss hunter he asked

 no i know no one in these parts

 dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to him to go away

 surely it would be better to take no notice

 no no we should have him loitering here always kindly turn round and wave him away like that

i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road

pray continue said holmes your narrative promises to be a most interesting one

you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches mr rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving about

 look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two planks is he not a beauty

i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness

 dont be frightened said my employer laughing at the start which i had given its only carlo my mastiff i call him mine but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him we feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard toller lets him loose every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon for goodness sake dont you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for its as much as your life is worth

the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two oclock in the morning it was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day i was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was it was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done

and now i have a very strange experience to tell you i had as you know cut off my hair in london and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk one evening after the child was in bed i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones empty and open the lower one locked i had filled the first two with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it the very first key fitted to perfection and i drew the drawer open there was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never guess what it was it was my coil of hair

i took it up and examined it it was of the same peculiar tint and the same thickness but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me how could my hair have been locked in the drawer with trembling hands i undid my trunk turned out the contents and drew from the bottom my own hair i laid the two tresses together and i assure you that they were identical was it not extraordinary puzzle as i would i could make nothing at all of what it meant i returned the strange hair to the drawer and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked

i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked one day however as i ascended the stair i met mr rucastle coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom i was accustomed his cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look

this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house there were four of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered up they were evidently all deserted as i strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever

 ah said he you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word my dear young lady i was preoccupied with business matters

i assured him that i was not offended by the way said i you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up

he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my remark

 photography is one of my hobbies said he i have made my dark room up there but dear me what an observant young lady we have come upon who would have believed it who would have ever believed it he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me i read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest

well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know i was all on fire to go over them it was not mere curiosity though i have my share of that it was more a feeling of dutya feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place they talk of womans instinct perhaps it was womans instinct which gave me that feeling at any rate it was there and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door

it was only yesterday that the chance came i may tell you that besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door recently he has been drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door i have no doubt at all that he had left it there mr and mrs rucastle were both downstairs and the child was with them so that i had an admirable opportunity i turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through

there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open they each led into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them the centre door was closed and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord the door itself was locked as well and the key was not there this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door a mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and i turned and ranran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress i rushed down the passage through the door and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting outside

 so said he smiling it was you then i thought that it must be when i saw the door open

 oh i am so frightened i panted

 my dear young lady my dear young ladyyou cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner wasand what has frightened you my dear young lady

but his voice was just a little too coaxing he overdid it i was keenly on my guard against him

 i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i answered but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again oh it is so dreadfully still in there

 only that said he looking at me keenly

 why what did you think i asked

 why do you think that i lock this door

 i am sure that i do not know

 it is to keep people out who have no business there do you see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner

 i am sure if i had known

 well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over that threshold againhere in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demonill throw you to the mastiff

i was so terrified that i do not know what i did i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then i thought of you mr holmes i could not live there longer without some advice i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child they were all horrible to me if i could only bring you down all would be well of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up i would send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three oclock for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do

holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face

is toller still drunk he asked

yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do nothing with him

that is well and the rucastles go out tonight

yes

is there a cellar with a good strong lock

yes the winecellar

you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman

i will try what is it

we shall be at the copper beeches by seven oclock my friend and i the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely

i will do it

excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of course there is only one feasible explanation you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of herspossibly her fianceand no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child

what on earth has that to do with it i ejaculated

my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents dont you see that the converse is equally valid i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children this childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power

i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature

we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man we can do nothing until seven oclock at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery

we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside publichouse the group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the doorstep

have you managed it asked holmes

a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs that is mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr rucastles

you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business

we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success no sound came from within and at the silence holmes face clouded over

i trust that we are not too late said he i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in

it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength together we rushed into the room it was empty there was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen the skylight above was open and the prisoner gone

there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim off

but how

through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it he swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cried heres the end of a long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did it

but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away

he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready

the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him

you villain said he wheres your daughter

the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight

it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves spies and thieves i have caught you have i you are in my power ill serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go

hes gone for the dog cried miss hunter

i have my revolver said i

better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door

my god he cried someone has loosed the dog its not been fed for two days quick quick or itll be too late

holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with toller hurrying behind us there was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in rucastles throat while he writhed and screamed upon the ground running up i blew its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck with much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house we laid him upon the drawingroom sofa and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to relieve his pain we were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room

mrs toller cried miss hunter

yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didnt let me know what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains were wasted

ha said holmes looking keenly at her it is clear that mrs toller knows more about this matter than anyone else

yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know

then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark

i will soon make it clear to you said she and id have done so before now if i could ha got out from the cellar if theres policecourt business over this youll remember that i was the one that stood your friend and that i was miss alices friend too

she was never happy at home miss alice wasnt from the time that her father married again she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friends house as well as i could learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastles hands he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money when she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she got brainfever and for six weeks was at deaths door then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be

ah said holmes i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce all that remains mr rucastle then i presume took to this system of imprisonment

yes sir

and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler

that was it sir

but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his

mr fowler was a very kindspoken freehanded gentleman said mrs toller serenely

and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out

you have it sir just as it happened

i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one

and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door mr rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife they still live with their old servants who probably know so much of rucastles past life that he finds it difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastle were married by special license in southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius as to miss violet hunter my friend holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at walsall where i believe that she has met with considerable success

preface


as things now stand the course of instruction in american history in
our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject
three separate books are used first there is the primary book which
is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and
anecdotes second there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth
grade generally speaking an expansion of the elementary book by the
addition of forty or fifty thousand words finally there is the high
school manual this too ordinarily follows the beaten path giving
fuller accounts of the same events and characters to put it bluntly we
do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their
study of history in the lower grades if mathematicians followed the
same method high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the
multiplication table and fractions

there is of course a ready answer to the criticism advanced above it
is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history
their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route no teacher of
history will deny this still it is a standing challenge to existing
methods of historical instruction if the study of history cannot be
made truly progressive like the study of mathematics science and
languages then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding
their subject to the already overloaded curriculum if the successive
historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first textmore
facts more dates more wordsthen history deserves most of the sharp
criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science civics and
economics

in this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a
new high school text in american history our first contribution is one
of omission the timehonored stories of exploration and the
biographies of heroes are left out we frankly hold that if pupils know
little or nothing about columbus cortes magellan or captain john
smith by the time they reach the high school it is useless to tell the
same stories for perhaps the fourth time it is worse than useless it
is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are
demonstrated to be progressive in character

in the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles our
reasons for this are simple the strategy of a campaign or of a single
battle is a highly technical and usually a highly controversial matter
about which experts differ widely in the field of military and naval
operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices to
dispose of gettysburg or the wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is
equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs any one who
compares the ordinary textbook account of a single civil war campaign
with the account given by ropes for instance will ask for no further
comment no youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think
of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of
warfare the dramatic scene or episode so useful in arousing the
interest of the immature pupil seems out of place in a book that
deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of lifes
serious responsibilities

it is not upon negative features however that we rest our case it is
rather upon constructive features

first we have written a topical not a narrative history we have
tried to set forth the important aspects problems and movements of
each period bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration

second we have emphasized those historical topics which help to
explain how our nation has come to be what it is today

third we have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our
history especially in relation to the politics of each period

fourth we have treated the causes and results of wars the problems
of financing and sustaining armed forces rather than military strategy
these are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians these
are matters which civilians can understandmatters which they must
understand if they are to play well their part in war and peace

fifth by omitting the period of exploration we have been able to
enlarge the treatment of our own time we have given special attention
to the history of those current questions which must form the subject
matter of sound instruction in citizenship

sixth we have borne in mind that america with all her unique
characteristics is a part of a general civilization accordingly we
have given diplomacy foreign affairs world relations and the
reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place

seventh we have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity the
study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory we
have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis comparison association
reflection and generalizationhabits calculated to enlarge as well as
inform the mind we have been at great pains to make our text clear
simple and direct but we have earnestly sought to stretch the
intellects of our readersto put them upon their mettle most of them
will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school
the world will soon expect maturity from them their achievements will
depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone the
effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by
the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their
information

part i the colonial period




chapter i

the great migration to america


the tide of migration that set in toward the shores of north america
during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in
the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the
earth the ancient greeks flung out their colonies in every direction
westward as far as gaul across the mediterranean and eastward into
asia minor perhaps to the very confines of india the romans supported
by their armies and their government spread their dominion beyond the
narrow lands of italy until it stretched from the heather of scotland to
the sands of arabia the teutonic tribes from their home beyond the
danube and the rhine poured into the empire of the caesars and made the
beginnings of modern europe of this great sweep of races and empires
the settlement of america was merely a part and it was moreover only
one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples the
institutions and the trade of europe to the very ends of the earth

in one vital point it must be noted american colonization differed
from that of the ancients the greeks usually carried with them
affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the
altar of the parent city but thousands of the immigrants who came to
america disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother
country they established compacts of government for themselves and set
up altars of their own they sought not only new soil to till but also
political and religious liberty for themselves and their children


the agencies of american colonization

it was no light matter for the english to cross three thousand miles of
water and found homes in the american wilderness at the opening of the
seventeenth century ships tools and supplies called for huge outlays
of money stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain
the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own
artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk
the hazards of the new world soldiers were required for defense and
mariners for the exploration of inland waters leaders of good judgment
adept in managing men had to be discovered altogether such an
enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or
gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to
assume though in later days after initial tests had been made wealthy
proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account it was
the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the
beginning

the trading companyenglish pioneers in exploration found an
instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers which
had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries
such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of
societynoblemen merchants and gentlemenwho banded together for a
particular undertaking each contributing a sum of money and sharing in
the profits of the venture it was organized under royal authority it
received its charter its grant of land and its trading privileges from
the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and
control the charter named all the persons originally included in the
corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its
affairs including the right to admit new members the company was in
fact a little government set up by the king when the members of the
corporation remained in england as in the case of the virginia company
they operated through agents sent to the colony when they came over the
seas themselves and settled in america as in the case of massachusetts
they became the direct government of the country they possessed the
stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor the
chief magistrate

illustration john winthrop governor of the massachusetts bay
company

four of the thirteen colonies in america owed their origins to the
trading corporation it was the london company created by king james i
in  that laid during the following year the foundations of virginia
at jamestown it was under the auspices of their west india company
chartered in  that the dutch planted the settlements of the new
netherland in the valley of the hudson the founders of massachusetts
were puritan leaders and men of affairs whom king charles i incorporated
in  under the title the governor and company of the massachusetts
bay in new england in this case the law did but incorporate a group
drawn together by religious ties we must be knit together as one man
wrote john winthrop the first puritan governor in america far to the
south on the banks of the delaware river a swedish commercial company
in  made the beginnings of a settlement christened new sweden it
was destined to pass under the rule of the dutch and finally under the
rule of william penn as the proprietary colony of delaware

in a certain sense georgia may be included among the company
colonies it was however originally conceived by the moving spirit
james oglethorpe as an asylum for poor men especially those imprisoned
for debt to realize this humane purpose he secured from king george
ii in  a royal charter uniting several gentlemen including
himself into one body politic and corporate known as the trustees
for establishing the colony of georgia in america in the structure of
their organization and their methods of government the trustees did not
differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and
colonization though their purposes were benevolent their transactions
had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business

the religious congregationa second agency which figured largely in
the settlement of america was the religious brotherhood or
congregation of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common
religious faith by one of the strange fortunes of history this
institution founded in the early days of christianity proved to be a
potent force in the origin and growth of selfgovernment in a land far
away from galilee and the multitude of them that believed were of one
heart and of one soul we are told in the acts describing the church at
jerusalem we are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of
the lord  by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all
care of each others good and of the whole wrote john robinson a
leader among the pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of plymouth in
 the mayflower compact so famous in american history was but a
written and signed agreement incorporating the spirit of obedience to
the common good which served as a guide to selfgovernment until
plymouth was annexed to massachusetts in 

illustration the original grants

three other colonies all of which retained their identity until the eve
of the american revolution likewise sprang directly from the
congregations of the faithful rhode island connecticut and new
hampshire mainly offshoots from massachusetts they were founded by
small bodies of men and women united in solemn covenants with the
lord who planted their settlements in the wilderness not until many a
year after roger williams and anne hutchinson conducted their followers
to the narragansett country was rhode island granted a charter of
incorporation  by the crown not until long after the congregation
of thomas hooker from newtown blazed the way into the connecticut river
valley did the king of england give connecticut a charter of its own
 and a place among the colonies half a century elapsed before the
towns laid out beyond the merrimac river by emigrants from massachusetts
were formed into the royal province of new hampshire in 

even when connecticut was chartered the parchment and sealing wax of
the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of selfgovernment
and obedience to law previously established by the congregations the
towns of hartford windsor and wethersfield had long lived happily
under their fundamental orders drawn up by themselves in  so had
the settlers dwelt peacefully at new haven under their fundamental
articles drafted in the same year the pioneers on the connecticut
shore had no difficulty in agreeing that the scriptures do hold forth a
perfect rule for the direction and government of all men

the proprietora third and very important colonial agency was the
proprietor or proprietary as the name associated with the word
property implies the proprietor was a person to whom the king
granted property in lands in north america to have hold use and enjoy
for his own benefit and profit with the right to hand the estate down
to his heirs in perpetual succession the proprietor was a rich and
powerful person prepared to furnish or secure the capital collect the
ships supply the stores and assemble the settlers necessary to found
and sustain a plantation beyond the seas sometimes the proprietor
worked alone sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the
common undertaking

five colonies maryland pennsylvania new jersey and the carolinas
owe their formal origins though not always their first settlements nor
in most cases their prosperity to the proprietary system maryland
established in  under a catholic nobleman lord baltimore and
blessed with religious toleration by the act of  flourished under
the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the american
union new jersey beginning its career under two proprietors berkeley
and carteret in  passed under the direct government of the crown
in  pennsylvania was in a very large measure the product of the
generous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor the leader
of the friends william penn to whom it was granted in  and in
whose family it remained until  the two carolinas were first
organized as one colony in  under the government and patronage of
eight proprietors including lord clarendon but after more than half a
century both became royal provinces governed by the king

the colonial peoples

the englishin leadership and origin the thirteen colonies except
new york and delaware were english during the early days of all save
these two the main if not the sole current of immigration was from
england the colonists came from every walk of life they were men
women and children of all sorts and conditions the major portion
were yeomen or small land owners farm laborers and artisans with
them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or
their fortunes to the new world scholars came from oxford and
cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach now and then the son of an
english nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with
america the people represented every religious faithmembers of the
established church of england puritans who had labored to reform that
church separatists baptists and friends who had left it altogether
and catholics who clung to the religion of their fathers

new england was almost purely english during the years between  and
 the period of arbitrary stuart government about twenty thousand
puritans emigrated to america settling in the colonies of the far
north although minor additions were made from time to time the greater
portion of the new england people sprang from this original stock
virginia too for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from
england alone not until the eve of the revolution did other
nationalities mainly the scotchirish and germans rival the english in
numbers

the populations of later english coloniesthe carolinas new york
pennsylvania and georgiawhile receiving a steady stream of
immigration from england were constantly augmented by wanderers from
the older settlements new york was invaded by puritans from new england
in such numbers as to cause the anglican clergymen there to lament that
free thinking spreads almost as fast as the church north carolina was
first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from virginia
some of the north carolinians particularly the quakers came all the
way from new england tarrying in virginia only long enough to learn how
little they were wanted in that anglican colony

the scotchirishnext to the english in numbers and influence were
the scotchirish presbyterians in belief english in tongue both
religious and economic reasons sent them across the sea their scotch
ancestors in the days of cromwell had settled in the north of ireland
whence the native irish had been driven by the conquerors sword there
the scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of
religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and
woolen cloth then the blow fell toward the end of the seventeenth
century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of
their cloth was forbidden by the english parliament within two decades
twenty thousand scotchirish left ulster alone for america and all
during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy
although no exact record was kept it is reckoned that the scotchirish
and the scotch who came directly from scotland composed onesixth of
the entire american population on the eve of the revolution

illustration settlements of german and scotchirish
immigrants

these newcomers in america made their homes chiefly in new jersey
pennsylvania maryland virginia and the carolinas coming late upon
the scene they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard
already taken up for this reason most of them became frontier people
settling the interior and upland regions there they cleared the land
laid out their small farms and worked as sturdy yeomen on the soil
hardy industrious and independent in spirit sharing neither the
luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely
merchants to their agriculture they added woolen and linen
manufactures which flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless
women made heavy inroads upon the trade of the english merchants in
the colonies of their labors a poet has sung

        o willing hands to toil
    strong natures tuned to the harvestsong and bound to the kindly soil
    bold pioneers for the wilderness defenders in the field

the germansthird among the colonists in order of numerical
importance were the germans from the very beginning they appeared in
colonial records a number of the artisans and carpenters in the first
jamestown colony were of german descent peter minuit the famous
governor of new motherland was a german from wesel on the rhine and
jacob leisler leader of a popular uprising against the provincial
administration of new york was a german from frankfortonmain the
wholesale migration of germans began with the founding of pennsylvania
penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his
lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the rhine
country a great association known as the frankfort company bought
more than twenty thousand acres from him and in  established a
center at germantown for the distribution of german immigrants in old
new york rhinebeckonthehudson became a similar center for
distribution all the way from maine to georgia inducements were offered
to the german farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found in
time german settlements in fact the migration became so large that
german princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and
england was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas
dominions yet nothing could stop the movement by the end of the
colonial period the number of germans had risen to more than two
hundred thousand

the majority of them were protestants from the rhine region and south
germany wars religious controversies oppression and poverty drove
them forth to america though most of them were farmers there were also
among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of
industries in pennsylvania their iron glass paper and woolen mills
dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions added to the
wealth and independence of the province

unlike the scotchirish the germans did not speak the language of the
original colonists or mingle freely with them they kept to themselves
built their own schools founded their own newspapers and published
their own books their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors
and led to occasional agitations against foreigners however no
serious collisions seem to have occurred and in the days of the
revolution german soldiers from pennsylvania fought in the patriot
armies side by side with soldiers from the english and scotchirish
sections

other nationalitiesthough the english the scotchirish and the
germans made up the bulk of the colonial population there were other
racial strains as well varying in numerical importance but contributing
their share to colonial life

from france came the huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which
inflicted terrible penalties upon protestants

from old ireland came thousands of native irish celtic in race and
catholic in religion like their scotchirish neighbors to the north
they revered neither the government nor the church of england imposed
upon them by the sword how many came we do not know but shipping
records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left
the southern and eastern shores of ireland for the new world
undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were irish of the native
stock this surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of
celtic names in the records of various colonies

the jews then as ever engaged in their agelong battle for religious
and economic toleration found in the american colonies not complete
liberty but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in england
france spain or portugal the english law did not actually recognize
their right to live in any of the dominions but owing to the easygoing
habits of the americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard
towns the treatment they received there varied on one occasion the
mayor and council of new york forbade them to sell by retail and on
another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship newport
philadelphia and charleston were more hospitable and there large
jewish colonies consisting principally of merchants and their families
flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law

though the small swedish colony in delaware was quickly submerged
beneath the tide of english migration the dutch in new york continued
to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the english
conquest in  at the end of the colonial period over onehalf of the
 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original
dutchstill distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and
manners of new york many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother
tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their dutch ovens
but they were slowly losing their identity as the english pressed in
beside them to farm and trade

the melting pot had begun its historic mission


the process of colonization

considered from one side colonization whatever the motives of the
emigrants was an economic matter it involved the use of capital to pay
for their passage to sustain them on the voyage and to start them on
the way of production under this stern economic necessity puritans
scotchirish germans and all were alike laid

immigrants who paid their own waymany of the immigrants to america
in colonial days were capitalists themselves in a small or a large way
and paid their own passage what proportion of the colonists were able
to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture
undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so for we can trace the
family fortunes of many early settlers henry cabot lodge is authority
for the statement that the settlers of new england were drawn from the
country gentlemen small farmers and yeomanry of the mother
country many of the emigrants were men of wealth as the old lists
show and all of them with few exceptions were men of property and
good standing they did not belong to the classes from which emigration
is usually supplied for they all had a stake in the country they left
behind though it would be interesting to know how accurate this
statement is or how applicable to the other colonies no study has as
yet been made to gratify that interest for the present it is an
unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the
cost of their own transfer to the new world

indentured servantsthat at least tens of thousands of immigrants
were unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of
a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us the great
barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to america was the cost
of the sea voyage to overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out
whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage
money to immigrants in return for their promise or bond to work for a
term of years to repay the sum advanced this system was called
indentured servitude

it is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original
twenty thousand puritans the yeomen the virginia gentlemen and the
huguenots combined all the way down the coast from massachusetts to
georgia were to be found in the fields kitchens and workshops men
women and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from
five to seven years in the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond
servants was very high the baltimores penns carterets and other
promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till
their fields for land without labor was worth no more than land in the
moon hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open
every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land
and special efforts were made to increase the population by importing
servants in pennsylvania it was not uncommon to find a master with
fifty bond servants on his estate it has been estimated that twothirds
of all the immigrants into pennsylvania between the opening of the
eighteenth century and the outbreak of the revolution were in bondage
in the other middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large but
it formed a considerable part of the population

the story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking
things in the history of labor bondmen differed from the serfs of the
feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master
they likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had
a time limit still they were subject to many special disabilities it
was for instance a common practice to impose on them penalties far
heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense a free
citizen of pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was
let off with a fine a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct
was whipped at the post and fined as well

the ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted a
bondman could not marry without his masters consent nor engage in
trade nor refuse work assigned to him for an attempt to escape or
indeed for any infraction of the law the term of service was extended
the condition of white bondmen in virginia according to lodge was
little better than that of slaves loose indentures and harsh laws put
them at the mercy of their masters it would not be unfair to add that
such was their lot in all other colonies their fate depended upon the
temper of their masters

cruel as was the system in many ways it gave thousands of people in the
old world a chance to reach the newan opportunity to wrestle with fate
for freedom and a home of their own when their weary years of servitude
were over if they survived they might obtain land of their own or
settle as free mechanics in the towns for many a bondman the gamble
proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise
out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude
carried him for thousands on the contrary bondage proved to be a real
avenue to freedom and prosperity some of the best citizens of america
have the blood of indentured servants in their veins

the transportedinvoluntary servitudein their anxiety to secure
settlers the companies and proprietors having colonies in america
either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men women
and children from the streets of english cities in  it was
officially estimated that ten thousand persons were spirited away to
america many of the victims of the practice were young children for
the traffic in them was highly profitable orphans and dependents were
sometimes disposed of in america by relatives unwilling to support them
in a single year  about fifteen hundred children were shipped to
virginia

in this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies and very few
romances parents were separated from their children and husbands from
their wives hundreds of skilled artisanscarpenters smiths and
weaversutterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death a few thus
dragged off to the new world to be sold into servitude for a term of
five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with
fortunes in one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea
lived to make his way back to england and establish his claim to a
peerage

akin to the kidnapped at least in economic position were convicts
deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment the
americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice
indeed they exaggerated its evils for many of the criminals were
only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws a peasant
caught shooting a rabbit on a lords estate or a luckless servant girl
who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with
sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals other transported offenders
were political criminals that is persons who criticized or opposed
the government this class included now irish who revolted against
british rule in ireland now cavaliers who championed the king against
the puritan revolutionists puritans in turn dispatched after the
monarchy was restored and scotch and english subjects in general who
joined in political uprisings against the king

the african slavesrivaling in numbers in the course of time the
indentured servants and whites carried to america against their will
were the african negroes brought to america and sold into slavery when
this form of bondage was first introduced into virginia in  it was
looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase
of the white population moreover it does not appear that those planters
who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a
system of permanent bondage only by a slow process did chattel slavery
take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor
supply in  thirty years after the introduction of slavery there
were only three hundred africans in virginia

the great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the
inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in old and in
new england finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in africa
they crowded the southern ports with their vessels the english royal
african company sent to america annually between  and  from five
to ten thousand slaves the ship owners of new england were not far
behind their english brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic

as the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily
rose and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders
the southern colonies grew alarmed in  virginia sought to curtail
the importation by placing a duty of  on each slave this effort was
futile for the royal governor promptly vetoed it from time to time
similar bills were passed only to meet with royal disapproval south
carolina in  absolutely prohibited importation but the measure
was killed by the british crown as late as  virginia not daunted
by a century of rebuffs sent to george iii a petition in this vein
the importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of africa
hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its
present encouragement we have too much reason to fear will endanger
the very existence of your majestys american dominions deeply
impressed with these sentiments we most humbly beseech your majesty to
remove all those restraints on your majestys governors of this colony
which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very
pernicious a commerce

all such protests were without avail the negro population grew by leaps
and bounds until on the eve of the revolution it amounted to more than
half a million in five statesmaryland virginia the two carolinas
and georgiathe slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites
in number in south carolina they formed almost twothirds of the
population even in the middle colonies of delaware and pennsylvania
about onefifth of the inhabitants were from africa to the north the
proportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was
on the same legal footing as in the south in new york approximately one
in six and in new england one in fifty were negroes including a few
freedmen

the climate the soil the commerce and the industry of the north were
all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population still slavery
though sectional was a part of the national system of economy northern
ships carried slaves to the southern colonies and the produce of the
plantations to europe if the northern states will consult their
interest they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will
increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers said
john rutledge of south carolina in the convention which framed the
constitution of the united states what enriches a part enriches the
whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest
responded oliver ellsworth the distinguished spokesman of connecticut

colonial agriculture industry and commerce

the land and the westward movement


the significance of land tenurethe way in which land may be
acquired held divided among heirs and bought and sold exercises a
deep influence on the life and culture of a people the feudal and
aristocratic societies of europe were founded on a system of landlordism
which was characterized by two distinct features in the first place
the land was nearly all held in great estates each owned by a single
proprietor in the second place every estate was kept intact under the
law of primogeniture which at the death of a lord transferred all his
landed property to his eldest son this prevented the subdivision of
estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders
owning their own land it made a form of tenantry or servitude
inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land it also
enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing
class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and
political control if land tenure was so significant in europe it was
equally important in the development of america where practically all
the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their
livelihood from the soil

experiments in common tillagein the new world with its broad
extent of land awaiting the white mans plow it was impossible to
introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords
and tenants that existed across the sea so it happened that almost
every kind of experiment in land tenure from communism to feudalism
was tried in the early days of the jamestown colony the land though
owned by the london company was tilled in common by the settlers no
man had a separate plot of his own the motto of the community was
labor and share alike all were supposed to work in the fields and
receive an equal share of the produce at plymouth the pilgrims
attempted a similar experiment laying out the fields in common and
distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among
the workers

in both colonies the communistic experiments were failures angry at the
lazy men in jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular
meals captain john smith issued a manifesto everyone that gathereth
not every day as much as i do the next day shall be set beyond the
river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve even
this terrible threat did not bring a change in production not until
each man was given a plot of his own to till not until each gathered
the fruits of his own labor did the colony prosper in plymouth where
the communal experiment lasted for five years the results were similar
to those in virginia and the system was given up for one of separate
fields in which every person could set corn for his own particular
some other new england towns refusing to profit by the experience of
their plymouth neighbor also made excursions into common ownership and
labor only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of
the land by degrees it was seen that even the lords people could not
carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome
practice

feudal elements in the coloniesquit rents manors and
plantationsat the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of
land tenure found in the proprietary colonies in the seaboard regions
of the south and to some extent in new york the proprietor was in fact
a powerful feudal lord owning land granted to him by royal charter he
could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in
large or small lots while he generally kept for himself an estate of
baronial proportions it was impossible for him to manage directly any
considerable part of the land in his dominion consequently he either
sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on
condition that they make to him an annual payment in money known as
quit rent in maryland the proprietor sometimes collected as high as
 equal to about  today in a single year from this
source in pennsylvania the quit rents brought a handsome annual
tribute into the exchequer of the penn family in the royal provinces
the king of england claimed all revenues collected in this form from the
land a sum amounting to  at the time of the revolution the quit
rentreally a feudal payment from freeholderswas thus a material
source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors wherever
it was laid however it proved to be a burden a source of constant
irritation and it became a formidable item in the long list of
grievances which led to the american revolution

something still more like the feudal system of the old world appeared in
the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown the
companies or the proprietors in the colony of maryland alone there
were sixty manors of three thousand acres each owned by wealthy men and
tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of
tenure in new york also there were many manors of wide extent most of
which originated in the days of the dutch west india company when
extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over
settlers the van rensselaer the van cortlandt and the livingston
manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a
representative to the provincial legislature the tenants on the new
york manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old european
estates they were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind they
ground their grain at his mill and they were subject to his judicial
power because he held court and meted out justice in some instances
extending to capital punishment

the manors of new york or maryland were however of slight consequence
as compared with the vast plantations of the southern seaboardhuge
estates far wider in expanse than many a european barony and tilled by
slaves more servile than any feudal tenants it must not be forgotten
that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large
section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of
america

illustration southern plantation mansion

the small freeholdin the upland regions of the south however and
throughout most of the north the drift was against all forms of
servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold that is
the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his
family this was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the
immigrants for one thing the abundance of land and the scarcity of
labor made it impossible for the companies the proprietors or the
crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates in
many sections particularly in new england the climate the stony soil
the hills and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a
moderate compass for another thing the english scotchirish and
german peasants even if they had been tenants in the old world did not
propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the new if they
could not get freeholds they would not settle at all thus they forced
proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in
small lots so it happened that the freehold of modest proportions
became the cherished unit of american farmers the people who tilled the
farms were drawn from every quarter of western europe but the freehold
system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in america

illustration from an old print

a new england farmhouse

social effects of land tenureland tenure and the process of western
settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the
same pursuitagriculture they had a common tie in that they both
cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence
which arise from that occupation their methods and their culture
however differed widely

the southern planter on his broad acres tilled by slaves resembled the
english landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who
labored with his own hands in the fields and forests he sold his rice
and tobacco in large amounts directly to english factors who took his
entire crop in exchange for goods and cash his fine clothes
silverware china and cutlery he bought in english markets loving the
ripe old culture of the mother country he often sent his sons to oxford
or cambridge for their education in short he depended very largely for
his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the
old world he did not even need market towns in which to buy native
goods for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who
were usually gifted slaves

the economic condition of the small farmer was totally different his
crops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with english
factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans he needed
local markets and they sprang up to meet the need smiths hatters
weavers wagonmakers and potters at neighboring towns supplied him
with the rough products of their native skill the finer goods bought
by the rich planter in england the small farmer ordinarily could not
buy his wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar and
between him and the european market stood the merchant his community
was therefore more selfsufficient than the seaboard line of great
plantations it was more isolated more provincial more independent
more american the planter faced the old east the farmer faced the new
west

the westward movementyeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in
one respect their land hunger was never appeased each had the eye of
an expert for new and fertile soil and so north and south as soon as
a foothold was secured on the atlantic coast the current of migration
set in westward creeping through forests across rivers and over
mountains many of the later immigrants in their search for cheap
lands were compelled to go to the border but in a large part the path
breakers to the west were native americans of the second and third
generations explorers fired by curiosity and the lure of the
mysterious unknown and hunters fur traders and squatters following
their own sweet wills blazed the trail opening paths and sending back
stories of the new regions they traversed then came the regular
settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased sometimes
singly and sometimes in companies

in massachusetts the westward movement is recorded in the founding of
springfield in  and great barrington in  by the opening of the
eighteenth century the pioneers of connecticut had pushed north and west
until their outpost towns adjoined the hudson valley settlements in new
york the inland movement was directed by the hudson river to albany
and from that old dutch center it radiated in every direction
particularly westward through the mohawk valley new jersey was early
filled to its borders the beginnings of the present city of new
brunswick being made in  and those of trenton in  in
pennsylvania as in new york the waterways determined the main lines of
advance pioneers pushing up through the valley of the schuylkill
spread over the fertile lands of berks and lancaster counties laying
out reading in  another current of migration was directed by the
susquehanna and in  the first farmhouse was built on the bank
where harrisburg was later founded along the southern tier of counties
a thin line of settlements stretched westward to pittsburgh reaching
the upper waters of the ohio while the colony was still under the penn
family

in the south the westward march was equally swift the seaboard was
quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the
cultivation of tobacco and rice the piedmont plateau lying back from
the coast all the way from maryland to georgia was fed by two streams
of migration one westward from the sea and the other southward from the
other coloniesgermans from pennsylvania and scotchirish furnishing
the main supply by  tidewater virginia was full to overflowing
and the back country of the blue ridge and the shenandoah was fully
occupied even the mountain valleys  were claimed by sturdy pioneers
before the declaration of independence the oncoming tide of
homeseekers had reached the crest of the alleghanies

illustration distribution of population 

beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured harbingers of an
invasion that was about to break in upon kentucky and tennessee as
early as  that mighty nimrod daniel boone curious to hunt
buffaloes of which he had heard weird reports passed through the
cumberland gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the
plow a hint was sufficient singly in pairs and in groups settlers
followed the trail he had blazed a great land corporation the
transylvania company emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier
times secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit
rents from lands sold to farmers by the outbreak of the revolution
there were several hundred people in the kentucky region like the older
colonists they did not relish quit rents and their opposition wrecked
the transylvania company they even carried their protests into the
continental congress in  for by that time they were our embryo
fourteenth colony


industrial and commercial development

though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming there was
a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits most of the
staple industries of today not omitting iron and textiles have their
beginnings in colonial times manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to
towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their
numbers the great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard
originated in the days when the king of england was lord of these
dominions

illustration domestic industry dipping tallow candles

textile manufacture as a domestic industrycolonial women in
addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering often the heavy labor
of the open field developed in the course of time a national industry
which was almost exclusively their own wool and flax were raised in
abundance in the north and south every farm house says coman the
economic historian was a workshop where the women spun and wove the
serges kerseys and linseywoolseys which served for the common wear
by the close of the seventeenth century new england manufactured cloth
in sufficient quantities to export it to the southern colonies and to
the west indies as the industry developed mills were erected for the
more difficult process of dyeing weaving and fulling but carding and
spinning continued to be done in the home the dutch of new netherland
the swedes of delaware and the scotchirish of the interior were not
one whit behind their yankee neighbors

the importance of this enterprise to british economic life can hardly be
overestimated for many a century the english had employed their fine
woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade and the
government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and
protection when the colonies were established both merchants and
statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value
but before long the americans instead of buying cloth especially of
the coarser varieties were making it to sell in the place of
customers here were rivals in the place of helpless reliance upon
english markets here was the germ of economic independence

if british merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of
trade observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news
to them even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal
governor of new york wrote of the industrious americans to his home
government the consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves
once not only comfortably but handsomely too without the help of
england they who already are not very fond of submitting to government
will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured
in their breasts this will not seem strange when you consider what sort
of people this country is inhabited by

the iron industryalmost equally widespread was the art of iron
workingone of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial
industries lynn massachusetts had a forge and skilled artisans within
fifteen years after the founding of boston the smelting of iron began
at new london and new haven about  in litchfield county
connecticut a few years later at great barrington massachusetts in
 and near by at lenox some thirty years after that new jersey had
iron works at shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the
colony in  iron forges appeared in the valleys of the delaware and
the susquehanna early in the following century and iron masters then
laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of
the great iron centers of the world virginia began iron working in the
year that saw the introduction of slavery although the industry soon
lapsed it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century
governor spotswood was called the tubal cain of the old dominion
because he placed the industry on a firm foundation indeed it seems
that every colony except georgia had its iron foundry nails wire
metallic ware chains anchors bar and pig iron were made in large
quantities and great britain by an act in  encouraged the
colonists to export rough iron to the british islands

shipbuildingof all the specialized industries in the colonies
shipbuilding was the most important the abundance of fir for masts oak
for timbers and boards pitch for tar and turpentine and hemp for rope
made the way of the shipbuilder easy early in the seventeenth century a
ship was built at new amsterdam and by the middle of that century
shipyards were scattered along the new england coast at newburyport
salem new bedford newport providence new london and new haven
yards at albany and poughkeepsie in new york built ships for the trade
of that colony with england and the indies wilmington and philadelphia
soon entered the race and outdistanced new york though unable to equal
the pace set by new england while maryland virginia and south
carolina also built ships southern interest was mainly confined to the
lucrative business of producing ship materials fir cedar hemp and
tar

fishingthe greatest single economic resource of new england outside
of agriculture was the fisheries this industry started by hardy
sailors from europe long before the landing of the pilgrims flourished
under the indomitable seamanship of the puritans who labored with the
net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the atlantic look
exclaimed edmund burke in the house of commons at the manner in
which the people of new england have of late carried on the whale
fishery whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and
behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of hudsons bay
and daviss straits while we are looking for them beneath the arctic
circle we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar
cold that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen
serpent of the south nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging
to them than the accumulated winter of both poles we know that whilst
some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of
africa others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along
the coast of brazil no sea but what is vexed by their fisheries no
climate that is not witness to their toils neither the perseverance of
holland nor the activity of france nor the dexterous and firm sagacity
of english enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard
industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent
people

the influence of the business was widespread a large and lucrative
european trade was built upon it the better quality of the fish caught
for food was sold in the markets of spain portugal and italy or
exchanged for salt lemons and raisins for the american market the
lower grades of fish were carried to the west indies for slave
consumption and in part traded for sugar and molasses which furnished
the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of new england these
activities in turn stimulated shipbuilding steadily enlarging the
demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the
shipwrights calkers rope makers and other artisans of the seaport
towns rushed with work they also increased trade with the mother
country for out of the cash collected in the fish markets of europe and
the west indies the colonists paid for english manufactures so an
everwidening circle of american enterprise centered around this single
industry the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit

oceanic commerce and american merchantsall through the eighteenth
century the commerce of the american colonies spread in every direction
until it rivaled in the number of people employed the capital engaged
and the profits gleaned the commerce of european nations a modern
historian has said the enterprising merchants of new england developed
a network of trade routes that covered wellnigh half the world this
commerce destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the
mother country presented broadly speaking two aspects

on the one side it involved the export of raw materials and
agricultural produce the southern colonies produced for shipping
tobacco rice tar pitch and pine the middle colonies grain flour
furs lumber and salt pork new england fish flour rum furs shoes
and small articles of manufacture the variety of products was in fact
astounding a sarcastic writer while sneering at the idea of an
american union once remarked of colonial trade what sort of dish will
you make new england will throw in fish and onions the middle states
flaxseed and flour maryland and virginia will add tobacco north
carolina pitch tar and turpentine south carolina rice and indigo
and georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust such an
absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such
discordant materials as the thirteen british provinces

on the other side american commerce involved the import trade
consisting principally of english and continental manufactures tea and
india goods sugar and molasses brought from the west indies
supplied the flourishing distilleries of massachusetts rhode island
and connecticut the carriage of slaves from africa to the southern
colonies engaged hundreds of new englands sailors and thousands of
pounds of her capital

the disposition of imported goods in the colonies though in part
controlled by english factors located in america employed also a large
and important body of american merchants like the willings and morrises
of philadelphia the amorys hancocks and faneuils of boston and the
livingstons and lows of new york in their zeal and enterprise they
were worthy rivals of their english competitors so celebrated for
worldwide commercial operations though fully aware of the advantages
they enjoyed in british markets and under the protection of the british
navy the american merchants were highspirited and mettlesome ready to
contend with royal officers in order to shield american interests
against outside interference

measured against the immense business of modern times colonial commerce
seems perhaps trivial that however is not the test of its
significance it must be considered in relation to the growth of english
colonial trade in its entiretya relation which can be shown by a few
startling figures the whole export trade of england including that to
the colonies was in   on the eve of the american
revolution namely in  english exports to the american colonies
alone amounted to  in other words almost as much as the
whole foreign business of england two generations before at the first
date colonial trade was but onetwelfth of the english export business
at the second date it was considerably more than onethird in 
pennsylvania bought in english markets goods to the value of  in
 the purchases of the same colony amounted to  in short
pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixtyeight years
amounting in  to almost the entire export trade of england to the
colonies at the opening of the century the american colonies were
indeed a great source of wealth to english merchants

intercolonial commercealthough the bad roads of colonial times made
overland transportation difficult and costly the many rivers and
harbors along the coast favored a lively waterborne trade among the
colonies the connecticut hudson delaware and susquehanna rivers in
the north and the many smaller rivers in the south made it possible for
goods to be brought from and carried to the interior regions in little
sailing vessels with comparative ease sloops laden with manufactures
domestic and foreign collected at some city like providence new york
or philadelphia skirted the coasts visited small ports and sailed up
the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange
the raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms
larger ships carried the grain live stock cloth and hardware of new
england to the southern colonies where they were traded for tobacco
leather tar and ship timber from the harbors along the connecticut
shores there were frequent sailings down through long island sound to
maryland virginia and the distant carolinas

growth of townsin connection with this thriving trade and industry
there grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers
which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole
british empire comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such
ports as liverpool and bristol the statistical records of that time are
mainly guesses but we know that philadelphia stood first in size among
these towns serving as the port of entry for pennsylvania delaware
and western jersey it had drawn within its borders just before the
revolution about  inhabitants boston was second in rank with
somewhat more than  people new york the commercial capital of
connecticut and old east jersey was slightly smaller than boston but
growing at a steady rate the fourth town in size was charleston south
carolina with about  inhabitants newport in rhode island a
center of rum manufacture and shipping stood fifth with a population
of about  baltimore and norfolk were counted as considerable
towns in the interior hartford in connecticut lancaster and york in
pennsylvania and albany in new york with growing populations and
increasing trade gave prophecy of an urban america away from the
seaboard the other towns were straggling villages williamsburg
virginia for example had about two hundred houses in which dwelt a
dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen inland county
seats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse a prison
and one wretched inn to house judges lawyers and litigants during the
sessions of the court

the leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of
proportion to their population they were the centers of wealth for one
thing of the press and political activity for another merchants and
artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising
from their commercial operations the towns were also centers for news
gossip religious controversy and political discussion in the market
places the farmers from the countryside learned of british policies and
laws and so mingling with the townsmen were drawn into the main
currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and
independence

chapter iii

social and political progress


colonial life crowded as it was with hard and unremitting toil left
scant leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences there was
little money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to
schools libraries and museums few there were with time to read long
and widely and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that
delight the eye and the mind and yet poor and meager as the
intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison heroic
efforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane
of mere existence after the first clearings were opened in the forests
those efforts were redoubled and with lengthening years told upon the
thought and spirit of the land the appearance during the struggle with
england of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history
political philosophy and the arts of war government and diplomacy
itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the american
intellect no one not even the most critical can run through the
writings of distinguished americans scattered from massachusetts to
georgiathe adamses ellsworth the morrises the livingstons
hamilton franklin washington madison marshall henry the randolphs
and the pinckneyswithout coming to the conclusion that there was
something in american colonial life which fostered minds of depth and
power women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the
process of selfeducation and their keen interest in public issues is
evident in many a record like the letters of mrs john adams to her
husband during the revolution the writings of mrs mercy otis warren
the sister of james otis who measured her pen with the british
propagandists and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women


the leadership of the churches

in the intellectual life of america the churches assumed a role of high
importance there were abundant reasons for this in many of the
coloniesmaryland pennsylvania and new englandthe religious impulse
had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration in all
the colonies the clergy at least in the beginning formed the only
class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit they preached
on sundays and taught school on week days they led in the discussion of
local problems and in the formation of political opinion so much of
which was concerned with the relation between church and state they
wrote books and pamphlets they filled most of the chairs in the
colleges under clerical guidance intellectual and spiritual the
americans received their formal education in several of the provinces
the anglican church was established by law in new england the puritans
were supreme notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their
authority in the middle colonies particularly the multiplication of
sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible and in
all of them there was a growing diversity of faith which promised in
time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion

the church of englandvirginia was the stronghold of the english
system of church and state the anglican faith and worship were
prescribed by law sustained by taxes imposed on all and favored by the
governor the provincial councilors and the richest planters the
established church says lodge was one of the appendages of the
virginia aristocracy they controlled the vestries and the ministers
and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the
planter who built and managed it as in england catholics and
protestant dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities only
slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province but when
once they were even covertly tolerated they pressed steadily in until
by the revolution they outnumbered the adherents of the established
order

the church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the
carolinas after  and in georgia after that colony passed directly
under the crown in this in spite of the fact that the majority of
the inhabitants were dissenters against the protests of the catholics
it was likewise established in maryland in new york too
notwithstanding the resistance of the dutch the established church was
fostered by the provincial officials and the anglicans embracing about
onefifteenth of the population exerted an influence all out of
proportion to their numbers

many factors helped to enhance the power of the english church in the
colonies it was supported by the british government and the official
class sent out to the provinces its bishops and archbishops in england
were appointed by the king and its faith and service were set forth by
acts of parliament having its seat of power in the english monarchy it
could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so
counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in
america the church always a strong bulwark of the state therefore had
a political role to play here as in england able bishops and farseeing
leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth
century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the
church in provincial affairs unhappily for their plans they failed to
calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting
protestants who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts
in the mother country

puritanism in new englandif the established faith made for imperial
unity the same could not be said of puritanism the plymouth pilgrims
had cast off all allegiance to the anglican church and established a
separate and independent congregation before they came to america the
puritans essaying at first the task of reformers within the church
soon after their arrival in massachusetts likewise flung off their yoke
of union with the anglicans in each town a separate congregation was
organized the male members choosing the pastor the teachers and the
other officers they also composed the voters in the town meeting where
secular matters were determined the union of church and government was
thus complete and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and
enforced by civil authorities but this worked for local autonomy
instead of imperial unity

the clergy became a powerful class dominant through their learning and
their fearful denunciations of the faithless they wrote the books for
the people to readthe famous cotton mather having three hundred and
eightythree books and pamphlets to his credit in cooperation with the
civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the puritan
sabbatha day of rest that began at six oclock on saturday evening and
lasted until sunset on sunday all work all trading all amusement and
all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours
a thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church
was in danger of being banished as a vagabond robert pike a devout
puritan thinking the sun had gone to rest ventured forth on horseback
one sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike
him through a rift in the clouds the next day he was brought into court
and fined for his ungodly conduct with persons accused of witchcraft
the puritans were still more ruthless when a mania of persecution swept
over massachusetts in  eighteen people were hanged one was pressed
to death many suffered imprisonment and two died in jail

just about this time however there came a break in the uniformity of
puritan rule the crown and church in england had long looked upon it
with disfavor and in  king charles ii annulled the old charter of
the massachusetts bay company a new document issued seven years later
wrested from the puritans of the colony the right to elect their own
governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king it also
abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members substituting
for it a simple property qualification thus a royal governor and an
official family certain to be episcopalian in faith and monarchist in
sympathies were forced upon massachusetts and members of all religious
denominations if they had the required amount of property were
permitted to take part in elections by this act in the name of the
crown the puritan monopoly was broken down in massachusetts and that
province was brought into line with connecticut rhode island and new
hampshire where property not religious faith was the test for the
suffrage

growth of religious tolerationthough neither the anglicans of
virginia nor the puritans of massachusetts believed in toleration for
other denominations that principle was strictly applied in rhode
island there under the leadership of roger williams liberty in
matters of conscience was established in the beginning maryland by
granting in  freedom to those who professed to believe in jesus
christ opened its gates to all christians and pennsylvania true to
the tenets of the friends gave freedom of conscience to those who
confess and acknowledge the one almighty and eternal god to be the
creator upholder and ruler of the world by one circumstance or
another the middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity
rather than uniformity of opinion dutch protestants huguenots
quakers baptists presbyterians new lights moravians lutherans
catholics and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and
too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule if it had
desired to do so there were communities and indeed whole sections where
one or another church prevailed but in no colony was a legislature
steadily controlled by a single group toleration encouraged diversity
and diversity in turn worked for greater toleration

the government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with
economic and political tendencies to draw america away from the english
state presbyterians quakers baptists and puritans had no hierarchy
of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in london
neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting
articles of faith local selfgovernment in matters ecclesiastical
helped to train them for local selfgovernment in matters political the
spirit of independence which led dissenters to revolt in the old world
nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the new world made
them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against
authority imposed from without


schools and colleges

religion and local schoolsone of the first cares of each protestant
denomination was the education of the children in the faith in this
work the bible became the center of interest the english version was
indeed the one book of the people farmers shopkeepers and artisans
whose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor found in
the scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct but also a
book of romance travel and history legend and annal says john
richard green warsong and psalm stateroll and biography the mighty
voices of prophets the parables of evangelists stories of mission
journeys of perils by sea and among the heathen philosophic arguments
apocalyptic visions all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for
the most part by any rival learning as a mere literary monument the
english version of the bible remains the noblest example of the english
tongue it was the king james version just from the press that the
pilgrims brought across the sea with them

for the authority of the established church was substituted the
authority of the scriptures the puritans devised a catechism based upon
their interpretation of the bible and very soon after their arrival in
america they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent
in seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious
works and give answers to the religious questions massachusetts was
scarcely twenty years old before education of this character was
declared to be compulsory and provision was made for public schools
where those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and
writing

       the earth around

     e elijah hid

     f the judgment made
       felix afraid



outside of new england the idea of compulsory education was not regarded
with the same favor but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with
little schools kept by dames itinerant teachers or local parsons
whether we turn to the life of franklin in the north or washington in
the south we read of tiny schoolhouses where boys and sometimes
girls were taught to read and write where there were no schools
fathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments
of learning though illiteracy was widespread there is evidence to show
that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady
progress all through the eighteenth century

religion and higher learningreligious motives entered into the
establishment of colleges as well as local schools harvard founded in
 and yale opened in  were intended primarily to train
learned and godly ministers for the puritan churches of new england
to the far north dartmouth chartered in  was designed first as a
mission to the indians and then as a college for the sons of new england
farmers preparing to preach teach or practice law the college of new
jersey organized in  and removed to princeton eleven years later
was sustained by the presbyterians two colleges looked to the
established church as their source of inspiration and support william
and mary founded in virginia in  and kings college now columbia
university chartered by king george ii in  on an appeal from the
new york anglicans alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the
republican tendencies of the age two colleges revealed a drift away
from sectarianism brown established in rhode island in  and the
philadelphia academy forerunner of the university of pennsylvania
organized by benjamin franklin reflected the spirit of toleration by
giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious
sects it was franklins idea that his college should prepare young men
to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to
their country

selfeducation in americaimportant as were these institutions of
learning higher education was by no means confined within their walls
many welltodo families sent their sons to oxford or cambridge in
england private tutoring in the home was common in still more families
there were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school
of adversity and who trained themselves until in every contest of mind
and wit they could vie with the sons of harvard or william and mary or
any other college such for example was benjamin franklin whose
charming autobiography in addition to being an american classic is a
fine record of selfeducation his formal training in the classroom was
limited to a few years at a local school in boston but his
selfeducation continued throughout his life he early manifested a zeal
for reading and devoured he tells us his fathers dry library on
theology bunyans works defoes writings plutarchs lives lockes
on the human understanding and innumerable volumes dealing with
secular subjects his literary style perhaps the best of his time
franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the
spectator in a life crowded with labors he found time to read widely
in natural science and to win singlehanded recognition at the hands of
european savants for his discoveries in electricity by his own efforts
he attained an acquaintance with latin italian french and spanish
thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak
for all america at the court of the king of france

lesser lights than franklin educated by the same process were found
all over colonial america from this fruitful source of native ability
selfeducated the american cause drew great strength in the trials of
the revolution


the colonial press

the rise of the newspaperthe evolution of american democracy into a
government by public opinion enlightened by the open discussion of
political questions was in no small measure aided by a free press that
too like education was a matter of slow growth a printing press was
brought to massachusetts in  but it was put in charge of an
official censor and limited to the publication of religious works forty
years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared bearing the curious
title public occurrences both foreign and domestic and it had not
been running very long before the government of massachusetts suppressed
it for discussing a political question

publishing indeed seemed to be a precarious business but in 
there came a second venture in journalism the boston newsletter
which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from
criticizing the authorities still the public interest languished when
franklins brother james began to issue his new england courant
about  his friends sought to dissuade him saying that one
newspaper was enough for america nevertheless he continued it and his
confidence in the future was rewarded in nearly every colony a gazette
or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more benjamin
franklin was able to record in  that america had twentyfive
newspapers boston led with five philadelphia had three two in english
and one in german

censorship and restraints on the pressthe idea of printing
unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church was
however slow in taking form the founders of the american colonies had
never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books
pamphlets broadsides and newspapers when the art of printing was
first discovered the control of publishing was vested in clerical
authorities after the establishment of the state church in england in
the reign of elizabeth censorship of the press became a part of royal
prerogative printing was restricted to oxford cambridge and london
and no one could publish anything without previous approval of the
official censor when the puritans were in power the popular party
with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown sought in turn to silence
royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship after the
restoration of the monarchy control of the press was once more placed
in royal hands where it remained until  when parliament by
failing to renew the licensing act did away entirely with the official

censorship by that time political parties were so powerful and so
active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all
published matter became a sheer impossibility

in america likewise some troublesome questions arose in connection
with freedom of the press the puritans of massachusetts were no less
anxious than king charles or the archbishop of london to shut out from
the prying eyes of the people all literature not mete for them to
read and so they established a system of official licensing for
presses which lasted until  in the other colonies where there was
more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with
impunity they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for
printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments in  the
editor of the mercury in philadelphia was called before the
proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article
and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail
a still more famous case was that of peter zenger a new york publisher
who was arrested in  for criticising the administration lawyers who
ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to
practice and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from
philadelphia by this time the tension of feeling was high and the
approbation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the
defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself not
that of the poor printer was on trial the verdict for zenger when it
finally came was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing
already the people of king georges province knew how precious a thing
is the freedom of the press

thanks to the schools few and scattered as they were and to the
vigilance of parents a very large portion perhaps nearly onehalf of
the colonists could read through the newspapers pamphlets and
almanacs that streamed from the types the people could follow the
course of public events and grasp the significance of political
arguments an american opinion was in the process of makingan
independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions
around the fireside and at the taverns when the day of resistance to
british rule came government by opinion was at hand for every person
who could hear the voice of patrick henry and samuel adams there were a
thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page men who had
spelled out their letters while poring over franklins poor richards
almanac lived to read thomas paines thrilling call to arms


the evolution in political institutions

two very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics
the one exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges was the
drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in
england the other leading toward democracy and selfgovernment was
the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly each
movement gave impetus to the other with increasing force during the
passing years until at last the final collision between the two ideals
of government came in the war of independence

the royal provincesof the thirteen english colonies eight were
royal provinces in  with governors appointed by the king virginia
passed under the direct rule of the crown in  when the charter of
the london company was annulled the massachusetts bay corporation lost
its charter in  and the new instrument granted seven years later
stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive in
the early decades of the eighteenth century both the carolinas were
given the provincial instead of the proprietary form new hampshire
severed from massachusetts in  and georgia surrendered by the
trustees in  went into the hands of the crown new york
transferred to the duke of york on its capture from the dutch in 
became a province when he took the title of james ii in  new
jersey after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors was
brought directly under the king in  maryland pennsylvania and
delaware although they retained their proprietary character until the
revolution were in some respects like the royal colonies for their
governors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees
of king george only two colonies rhode island and connecticut
retained full selfgovernment on the eve of the revolution they alone
had governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing

the chief officer of the royal province was the governor who enjoyed
high and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every
turn he enforced the laws and usually with the consent of a council
appointed the civil and military officers he granted pardons and
reprieves he was head of the highest court he was commanderinchief
of the militia he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in
time of invasion war and rebellion in all the provinces except
massachusetts he named the councilors who composed the upper house of
the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims
he summoned adjourned and dissolved the popular assembly or the lower
house he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown and
he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable here were in america
all the elements of royal prerogative against which hampden had
protested and cromwell had battled in england

illustration the royal governors palace at new berne

the colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of
officeseekers and hunters for land grants some of them were noblemen
of broken estates who had come to america to improve their fortunes the
pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves and privileges
granted to them often at the expense of colonists did much to deepen
popular antipathy to the british government favors extended to
adherents of the established church displeased dissenters the
reappearance of this formidable union of church and state from which
they had fled stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination

the colonial assemblycoincident with the drift toward
administration through royal governors was the second and opposite
tendency namely a steady growth in the practice of selfgovernment
the voters of england had long been accustomed to share in taxation and
lawmaking through representatives in parliament and the idea was early
introduced in america virginia was only twelve years old  when
its first representative assembly appeared as the towns of
massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of
the corporation to meet at one place the representative idea was
adopted in  the river towns of connecticut formed a representative
system under their fundamental orders of  and the entire colony
was given a royal charter in  generosity as well as practical
considerations induced such proprietors as lord baltimore and william
penn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any
considerable settlements were made thus by one process or another every
one of the colonies secured a popular assembly

it is true that in the provision for popular elections the suffrage was
finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers with a leaning
toward the freehold qualification in virginia the rural voter had to
be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land if there was no
house on it or twentyfive acres with a house twentyfive feet square
in massachusetts the voter for member of the assembly under the charter
of  had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year
at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling in
pennsylvania the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres
or more of land well seated twelve acres cleared and to other persons
worth at least fifty pounds in lawful money

restrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very
considerable number of men particularly the mechanics and artisans of
the towns who were by no means content with their position
nevertheless it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small
freehold so cheap and abundant was land and in fact a large proportion
of the colonists were land owners thus the assemblies in spite of the
limited suffrage acquired a democratic tone

the popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged
in battles with the royal and proprietary governors when called upon by
the executive to make provision for the support of the administration
the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the
interest of the taxpayers it made annual not permanent grants of
money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a
treasurer to dole it out thus the colonists learned some of the
mysteries of public finance as well as the management of rapacious
officials the legislature also used its power over money grants to
force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed

contests between legislatures and governorsas may be imagined many
and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors
and the colonial assemblies franklin relates an amusing story of how
the pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to
sign and in the other hand the money to pay his salary then with sly
humor franklin adds do not my courteous reader take pet at our
proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in
legislation it is a happy country where justice and what was your own
before can be had for ready money it is another addition to the value
of money and of course another spur to industry every land is not so
blessed

it must not be thought however that every governor got off as easily
as franklins tale implies on the contrary the legislatures like
caesar fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon
executive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength if
we may believe contemporary laments the power of the crown in america
was diminishing when it was struck down altogether in new york the
friends of the governor complained in  that the inhabitants of
plantations are generally educated in republican principles upon
republican principles all is conducted little more than a shadow of
royal authority remains in the northern colonies here echoed the
governor of south carolina the following year levelling principles
prevail the frame of the civil government is unhinged a governor if
he would be idolized must betray his trust the people have got their
whole administration in their hands the election of the members of the
assembly is by ballot not civil posts only but all ecclesiastical
preferments are in the disposal or election of the people

though baffled by the levelling principles of the colonial assemblies
the governors did not give up the case as hopeless instead they evolved
a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the
obstinate provincials to terms that system traceable in their letters
to the government in london consisted of three parts  the royal
officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures
by taxes imposed by acts of parliament  a british standing army was
to be maintained in america  the remaining colonial charters were to
be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged

such a system seemed plausible enough to king george iii and to many
ministers of the crown in london with governors courts and an army
independent of the colonists they imagined it would be easy to carry
out both royal orders and acts of parliament this reasoning seemed both
practical and logical nor was it founded on theory for it came fresh
from the governors themselves it was wanting in one respect only it
failed to take account of the fact that the american people were growing
strong in the practice of selfgovernment and could dispense with the
tutelage of the british ministry no matter how excellent it might be or
how benevolent its intentions

chapter iv

the development of colonial nationalism


it is one of the wellknown facts of history that a people loosely
united by domestic ties of a political and economic nature even a
people torn by domestic strife may be welded into a solid and compact
body by an attack from a foreign power the imperative call to common
defense the habit of sharing common burdens the fusing force of common
servicethese things induced by the necessity of resisting outside
interference act as an amalgam drawing together all elements except
perhaps the most discordant the presence of the enemy allays the most
virulent of quarrels temporarily at least politics runs an old
saying stops at the waters edge

this ancient political principle so well understood in diplomatic
circles applied nearly as well to the original thirteen american
colonies as to the countries of europe the necessity for common
defense if not equally great was certainly always pressing though it
has long been the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded
in a wilderness this was not actually the case from the earliest
days of jamestown on through the years the american people were
confronted by dangers from without all about their tiny settlements
were indians growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and
as sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions to the south and
west was the power of spain humiliated it is true by the disaster to
the armada but still presenting an imposing front to the british
empire to the north and west were the french ambitious energetic
imperial in temper and prepared to contest on land and water the
advance of british dominion in america


relations with the indians and the french

indian affairsit is difficult to make general statements about the
relations of the colonists to the indians the problem was presented in
different shape in different sections of america it was not handled
according to any coherent or uniform plan by the british government
which alone could speak for all the provinces at the same time neither
did the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another in an
irregular train have the consistent policy or the matured experience
necessary for dealing wisely with indian matters as the difficulties
arose mainly on the frontiers where the restless and pushing pioneers
were making their way with gun and ax nearly everything that happened
was the result of chance rather than of calculation a personal quarrel
between traders and an indian a jug of whisky a keg of gunpowder the
exchange of guns for furs personal treachery or a flash of bad temper
often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character

on one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous recordsof
squanto and samoset teaching the pilgrims the ways of the wilds of
roger williams buying his lands from the friendly natives or of william
penn treating with them on his arrival in america on the other side of
the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the
frontier rolled westward with deadly precision the pequots on the
connecticut border sensing their doom fell upon the tiny settlements
with awful fury in  only to meet with equally terrible punishment a
generation later king philip son of massasoit the friend of the
pilgrims called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought
the strength of all new england to the field and ended in his own
destruction in new york the relations with the indians especially
with the algonquins and the mohawks were marked by periodic and
desperate wars virginia and her southern neighbors suffered as did new
england in  opecacano a brother of powhatan the friend of the
jamestown settlers launched a general massacre and in  he
attempted a war of extermination in  the whole frontier was ablaze
nathaniel bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up
an adequate defense and failing in that plea himself headed a revolt
and a successful expedition against the indians as the virginia
outposts advanced into the kentucky country the strife with the natives
was transferred to that dark and bloody ground while to the
southeast a desperate struggle with the tuscaroras called forth the
combined forces of the two carolinas and virginia

from such horrors new jersey and delaware were saved on account of their
geographical location pennsylvania consistently following a policy of
conciliation was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into
full conflict with the allied french and indians georgia by clever
negotiations and treaties of alliance managed to keep on fair terms
with her belligerent cherokees and creeks but neither diplomacy nor
generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced
especially after the french soldiers enlisted the indians in their
imperial enterprises it was then that desultory fighting became general
warfare

illustration english french and spanish possessions in america


early relations with the frenchduring the first decades of french
exploration and settlement in the st lawrence country the english
colonies engrossed with their own problems gave little or no thought
to their distant neighbors quebec founded in  and montreal in
 were too far away too small in population and too slight in
strength to be much of a menace to boston hartford or new york it was
the statesmen in france and england rather than the colonists in
america who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging
empires in north america it was the ambition of louis xiv of france
rather than the labors of jesuit missionaries and french rangers that
sounded the first note of colonial alarm

evidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the
english and the french occurred before their advancing frontiers met on
the pennsylvania border king williams war  queen annes
war  and king georges war  owed their origins
and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of european
powers although they all involved the american colonies in struggles
with the french and their savage allies

the clash in the ohio valleythe second of these wars had hardly
closed however before the english colonists themselves began to be
seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding french dominion in the
west marquette and joliet who opened the lake region and la salle
who in  had gone down the mississippi to the gulf had been followed
by the builders of forts in  the french founded new orleans thus
taking possession of the gateway to the mississippi as well as the st
lawrence a few years later they built fort niagara in  they
occupied crown point in  they formally announced their dominion
over all the territory drained by the ohio river having asserted this
lofty claim they set out to make it good by constructing in the years
 fort le boeuf near lake erie fort venango on the upper
waters of the allegheny and fort duquesne at the junction of the
streams forming the ohio though they were warned by george washington
in the name of the governor of virginia to keep out of territory so
notoriously known to be property of the crown of great britain the
french showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions

braddocks retreat

the final phasethe french and indian warthus it happened that the
shot which opened the seven years war known in america as the french
and indian war was fired in the wilds of pennsylvania there began the
conflict that spread to europe and even asia and finally involved
england and prussia on the one side and france austria spain and
minor powers on the other on american soil the defeat of braddock in
 and wolfes exploit in capturing quebec four years later were the
dramatic features on the continent of europe england subsidized
prussian arms to hold france at bay in india on the banks of the
ganges as on the banks of the st lawrence british arms were
triumphant well could the historian write conquests equaling in
rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of cortes and pizarro had
been achieved in the east well could the merchants of london declare
that under the administration of william pitt the imperial genius of
this worldwide conflict commerce had been united with and made to
flourish by war

from the point of view of the british empire the results of the war
were momentous by the peace of  canada and the territory east of
the mississippi except new orleans passed under the british flag the
remainder of the louisiana territory was transferred to spain and french
imperial ambitions on the american continent were laid to rest in
exchange for havana which the british had seized during the war spain
ceded to king george the colony of florida not without warrant did
macaulay write in after years that pitt was the first englishman of his
time and he had made england the first country in the world


the effects of warfare on the colonies

the various wars with the french and the indians trivial in detail as
they seem today had a profound influence on colonial life and on the
destiny of america circumstances beyond the control of popular
assemblies jealous of their individual powers compelled cooperation
among them grudging and stingy no doubt but still cooperation the
american people more eager to be busy in their fields or at their
trades were simply forced to raise and support armies to learn the
arts of warfare and to practice if in a small theater the science of
statecraft these forces all cumulative drove the colonists so
tenaciously provincial in their habits in the direction of nationalism

the new england confederationit was in their efforts to deal with
the problems presented by the indian and french menace that the
americans took the first steps toward union though there were many
common ties among the settlers of new england it required a deadly
fear of the indians to produce in  the new england confederation
composed of massachusetts plymouth connecticut and new haven the
colonies so united were bound together in a firm and perpetual league
of friendship and amity for offense and defense mutual service and
succor upon all just occasions they made provision for distributing
the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of
commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies for
some twenty years the confederation was active and it continued to hold
meetings until after the extinction of the indian peril on the immediate
border

virginia no less than massachusetts was aware of the importance of
intercolonial cooperation in the middle of the seventeenth century the
old dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with new york and the
colonies of new england in  delegates from virginia met at albany
with the agents of new york and massachusetts to discuss problems of
mutual defense a few years later the old dominion cooperated loyally
with the carolinas in defending their borders against indian forays

the albany plan of unionan attempt at a general colonial union was
made in  on the suggestion of the lords of trade in england a
conference was held at albany to consider indian relations to devise
measures of defense against the french and to enter into articles of
union and confederation for the general defense of his majestys
subjects and interests in north america as well in time of peace as of
war new hampshire massachusetts connecticut rhode island new york
pennsylvania and maryland were represented after a long discussion a
plan of union drafted mainly it seems by benjamin franklin was
adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval the
colonies jealous of their individual rights refused to accept the
scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason franklin said that
it had too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution
though the albany union failed the document is still worthy of study
because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved
until thirtythree years afterward when another convention of which
also franklin was a member drafted the constitution of the united
states

illustration benjamin franklin

the military education of the coloniststhe same wars that showed
the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art
of defending their institutions particularly was this true of the last
french and indian conflict which stretched all the way from maine to
the carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops the answer
it is admitted was far from satisfactory to the british government and
the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional but thousands
of americans got a taste a strong taste of actual fighting in the
field men like george washington and daniel morgan learned lessons that
were not forgotten in after years they saw what american militiamen
could do under favorable circumstances and they watched british regulars
operating on american soil this whole transaction shrewdly remarked
franklin of braddocks campaign gave us americans the first suspicion
that our exalted ideas of the prowess of british regular troops had not
been well founded it was no mere accident that the virginia colonel
who drew his sword under the elm at cambridge and took command of the
army of the revolution was the brave officer who had spurned the
whistle of bullets at the memorable battle in western pennsylvania

financial burdens and commercial disorderwhile the provincials were
learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills all the
conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood king philips war left
new england weak and almost bankrupt the french and indian struggle was
especially expensive the twentyfive thousand men put in the field by
the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money paper
currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated commerce
was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced when the
end came both england and america were staggering under heavy
liabilities and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices
accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of
ten years it was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation
had to be devised to pay the cost of the war precipitating the quarrel
which led to american independence

the expulsion of french power from north americathe effects of the
defeat administered to france as time proved were difficult to
estimate some british statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance
that the colonists already restive under their administration had no
foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence
american leaders on the other hand now that the soldiers of king louis
were driven from the continent thought that they had no other country
to fear if they cast off british sovereignty at all events france
though defeated was not out of the sphere of american influence for
as events proved it was the fortunate french alliance negotiated by
franklin that assured the triumph of american arms in the war of the
revolution


colonial relations with the british government

it was neither the indian wars nor the french wars that finally brought
forth american nationality that was the product of the long strife
with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of
independence the forces that created this nation did not operate in the
colonies alone the character of the english sovereigns the course of
events in english domestic politics and english measures of control
over the coloniesexecutive legislative and judicialmust all be
taken into account

the last of the stuartsthe struggles between charles i 
and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the puritan regime
 so engrossed the attention of englishmen at home that they had
little time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial
affairs the restoration of the monarchy in  accompanied by
internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the
house of commons changed all that in the reign of charles ii
 himself an easygoing person the policy of regulating trade
by act of parliament was developed into a closely knit system and
powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created at the same
time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by
the annulment of the old charter of massachusetts which conferred so
much selfgovernment on the puritans

charles successor james ii a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his
authority in the colonies as well as at home continued the policy thus
inaugurated and enlarged upon it if he could have kept his throne he
would have bent the americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his
dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 
he determined to unite the northern colonies and introduce a more
efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces he
made a martinet sir edmund andros governor of all new england new
york and new jersey the charter of massachusetts annulled in the last
days of his brothers reign he continued to ignore and that of
connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and
hidden according to tradition in a hollow oak

for several months andros gave the northern colonies a taste of
illtempered despotism he wrung quit rents from land owners not
accustomed to feudal dues he abrogated titles to land where in his
opinion they were unlawful he forced the episcopal service upon the
old south church in boston and he denied the writ of habeas corpus to
a preacher who denounced taxation without representation in the middle
of his arbitrary course however his hand was stayed the news came
that king james had been dethroned by his angry subjects and the people
of boston kindling a fire on beacon hill summoned the countryside to
dispose of andros the response was prompt and hearty the hated
governor was arrested imprisoned and sent back across the sea under
guard

the overthrow of james followed by the accession of william and mary
and by assured parliamentary supremacy had an immediate effect in the
colonies the new order was greeted with thanksgiving massachusetts was
given another charter which though not so liberal as the first
restored the spirit if not the entire letter of selfgovernment in the
other colonies where andros had been operating the old course of
affairs was resumed

the indifference of the first two georgeson the death in  of
queen anne the successor of king william the throne passed to a
hanoverian prince who though grateful for english honors and revenues
was more interested in hanover than in england george i and george ii
whose combined reigns extended from  to  never even learned to
speak the english language at least without an accent the necessity of
taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the
stoutest defender of popular privileges in boston or charleston had no
ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king
moreover during a large part of this period the direction of affairs
was in the hands of an astute leader sir robert walpole who betrayed
his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto let
sleeping dogs lie he revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment
by exclaiming i will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the
expense of blood such kings and such ministers were not likely to
arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the
sea

control of the crown over the colonieswhile no english ruler from
james ii to george iii ventured to interfere with colonial matters
personally constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal
officers acting under the authority of the crown systematic supervision
began in  when there was created by royal order a committee of the
kings council to meet on mondays and thursdays of each week to consider
petitions memorials and addresses respecting the plantations in 
a regular board was established known as the lords of trade and
plantations which continued until the american revolution to
scrutinize closely colonial business the chief duties of the board were
to examine acts of colonial legislatures to recommend measures to those
assemblies for adoption and to hear memorials and petitions from the
colonies relative to their affairs

the methods employed by this board were varied all laws passed by
american legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine
if it found an act unsatisfactory it recommended to the king the
exercise of his veto power known as the royal disallowance any person
who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law
could be heard by the board in person or by attorney in such cases it
was the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so
involved the royal veto power over colonial legislation was not
therefore a formal affair but was constantly employed on the
suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown all this was in
addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal
provinces

judicial controlsupplementing this administrative control over the
colonies was a constant supervision by the english courts of law the
king by virtue of his inherent authority claimed and exercised high
appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire the right
of appeal from local courts expressly set forth in some charters was
on the eve of the revolution maintained in every colony any subject in
england or america who in the regular legal course was aggrieved by
any act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court
had the right subject to certain regulations to carry his case to the
king in council forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea in
the exercise of appellate power the king in council acting as a court
could and frequently did declare acts of colonial legislatures duly
enacted and approved null and void on the ground that they were
contrary to english law

imperial control in operationday after day week after week year
after year the machinery for political and judicial control over
colonial affairs was in operation at one time the british governors in
the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a
duty on european goods imported in english vessels again when north
carolina laid a tax on peddlers the council objected to it as
restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of english manufactures
throughout the continent at other times indian trade was regulated in
the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial
legislature were set aside virginia was forbidden to close her ports to
north carolina lest there should be retaliation

in short foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control
higher than that of the colony foreshadowing a day when the
constitution of the united states was to commit to congress the power to
regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the indians
a superior judicial power towering above that of the colonies as the
supreme court at washington now towers above the states kept the
colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law in
the thousands of appeals memorials petitions and complaints and the
rulings and decisions upon them were written the real history of
british imperial control over the american colonies

so great was the business before the lords of trade that the colonies
had to keep skilled agents in london to protect their interests as
common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control
arose there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men with
the merchants in the lead who chafed at the restraints imposed on their
enterprise only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a
common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism when to the
repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of
parliament applying to every colony the rebound came in the revolution

parliamentary control over colonial affairsas soon as parliament
gained in power at the expense of the king it reached out to bring the
american colonies under its sway as well between the execution of
charles i and the accession of george iii there was enacted an immense
body of legislation regulating the shipping trade and manufactures of
america all of it based on the mercantile theory then prevalent in
all countries of europe was designed to control the overseas
plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business
interests of the mother country where merchants and men of finance had
got the upper hand according to this theory the colonies of the
british empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of
raw materials and forced to buy their manufactured goods of england

the navigation actsin the first rank among these measures of
british colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for
the purpose of building up the british merchant marine and navyarms so
essential in defending the colonies against the spanish dutch and
french the beginning of this type of legislation was made in  and
it was worked out into a system early in the reign of charles ii


the navigation acts in effect gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to
british ships no trade could be carried on between great britain and
her dominions save in vessels built and manned by british subjects no
european goods could be brought to america save in the ships of the
country that produced them or in english ships these laws which were
almost fatal to dutch shipping in america fell with severity upon the
colonists compelling them to pay higher freight rates the adverse
effect however was shortlived for the measures stimulated
shipbuilding in the colonies where the abundance of raw materials gave
the master builders of america an advantage over those of the mother
country thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive
policy written into the navigation acts

the acts against manufacturesthe second group of laws was
deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too
sharply with those of england among the earliest of these measures may
be counted the woolen act of  forbidding the exportation of woolen
goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and
colonies when parliament learned as the result of an inquiry that new
england and new york were making thousands of hats a year and sending
large numbers annually to the southern colonies and to ireland spain
and portugal it enacted in  a law declaring that no hats or felts
dyed or undyed finished or unfinished should be put upon any vessel
or laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place
whatever the effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost
ruinous a few years later a similar blow was given to the iron
industry by an act of  pig and bar iron from the colonies were
given free entry to england to encourage the production of the raw
material but at the same time the law provided that no mill or other
engine for slitting or rolling of iron no plating forge to work with a
tilt hammer and no furnace for making steel should be built in the
colonies as for those already built they were declared public
nuisances and ordered closed thus three important economic interests of
the colonists the woolen hat and iron industries were laid under the
ban

the trade lawsthe third group of restrictive measures passed by the
british parliament related to the sale of colonial produce an act of
 required the colonies to export certain articles to great britain
or to her dominions alone while sugar tobacco and ginger consigned to
the continent of europe had to pass through a british port paying custom
duties and through a british merchants hands paying the usual
commission at first tobacco was the only one of the enumerated
articles which seriously concerned the american colonies the rest
coming mainly from the british west indies in the course of time
however other commodities were added to the list of enumerated
articles until by  it embraced rice naval stores copper furs
hides iron lumber and pearl ashes this was not all the colonies
were compelled to bring their european purchases back through english
ports paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants
again

the molasses actnot content with laws enacted in the interest of
english merchants and manufacturers parliament sought to protect the
british west indies against competition from their french and dutch
neighbors new england merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade
with the french islands in the west indies and dutch guiana where sugar
and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices acting
on the protests of english planters in the barbadoes and jamaica
parliament in  passed the famous molasses act imposing duties on
sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign
countriesrates which would have destroyed the american trade with the
french and dutch if the law had been enforced the duties however were
not collected the molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on
merrily smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic

effect of the laws in americaas compared with the strict monopoly
of her colonial trade which spain consistently sought to maintain the
policy of england was both moderate and liberal furthermore the
restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be
favorable to colonial prosperity the navigation acts for example
redounded to the advantage of american shipbuilders and the producers
of hemp tar lumber and ship stores in general favors in british
ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors
and in some instances bounties were paid by england to encourage
colonial enterprise taken all in all there is much justification in
the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the
colonists gained more than they lost by british trade and industrial
legislation certainly after the establishment of independence when
free from these old restrictions the americans found themselves
handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders
and the recipients of bounties in english markets

be that as it may it appears that the colonists felt little irritation
against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws
enacted previous to the close of the french and indian war relatively
few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those
in farming and planting so that englands policy of restricting america
to agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of
the inhabitants the woolen industry was largely in the hands of women
and carried on in connection with their domestic duties so that it was
not the sole support of any considerable number of people

as a matter of fact moreover the restrictive laws especially those
relating to trade were not rigidly enforced cargoes of tobacco were
boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the
english government to which duties should have been paid sugar and
molasses from the french and dutch colonies were shipped into new
england in spite of the law royal officers sometimes protested against
smuggling and sometimes connived at it but at no time did they succeed
in stopping it taken all in all very little was heard of the galling
restraints of trade until after the french war when the british
government suddenly entered upon a new course


summary of the colonial period

in the period between the landing of the english at jamestown virginia
in  and the close of the french and indian war in a period of
a century and a halfa new nation was being prepared on this continent
to take its place among the powers of the earth it was an epoch of
migration western europe contributed emigrants of many races and
nationalities the english led the way next to them in numerical
importance were the scotchirish and the germans into the melting pot
were also cast dutch swedes french jews welsh and irish thousands
of negroes were brought from africa to till southern fields or labor as
domestic servants in the north

why did they come the reasons are various some of them the pilgrims
and puritans of new england the french huguenots scotchirish and
irish and the catholics of maryland fled from intolerant governments
that denied them the right to worship god according to the dictates of
their consciences thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in
the old world and to find free homes in america thousands like the
negroes from africa were dragged here against their will the lure of
adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the
enterprising merchants

how did they come in some cases religious brotherhoods banded together
and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way in other
cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies again it
was the wealthy proprietor like lord baltimore or william penn who
undertook to plant settlements many immigrants were able to pay their
own way across the sea others bound themselves out for a term of years
in exchange for the cost of the passage negroes were brought on account
of the profits derived from their sale as slaves

whatever the motive for their coming however they managed to get
across the sea the immigrants set to work with a will they cut down
forests built houses and laid out fields they founded churches
schools and colleges they set up forges and workshops they spun and
wove they fashioned ships and sailed the seas they bartered and
traded here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of
commerceboston providence new york philadelphia baltimore and
charleston as soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line
they pressed westward until by the close of the colonial period they
were already on the crest of the alleghanies

though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast
the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties the major
portion of them were protestants the language the law and the
literature of england furnished the basis of national unity most of the
colonists were engaged in the same hard task that of conquering a
wilderness to ties of kinship and language were added ties created by
necessity they had to unite in defense first against the indians and
later against the french they were all subjects of the same
sovereignthe king of england the english parliament made laws for
them and the english government supervised their local affairs their
trade and their manufactures common forces assailed them common
grievances vexed them common hopes inspired them

many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw
them into opposition to the british crown and parliament most of them
were freeholders that is farmers who owned their own land and tilled
it with their own hands a free soil nourished the spirit of freedom
the majority of them were dissenters critics not friends of the
church of england that stanch defender of the british monarchy each
colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters it
grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself here was a
people learning selfreliance and selfgovernment the attempts to
strengthen the church of england in america and the transformation of
colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence
which they were designed to quench

nevertheless the americans owed much of their prosperity to the
assistance of the government that irritated them it was the protection
of the british navy that prevented holland spain and france from
wiping out their settlements though their manufacture and trade were
controlled in the interests of the mother country they also enjoyed
great advantages in her markets free trade existed nowhere upon the
earth but the broad empire of britain was open to american ships and
merchandise it could be said with good reason that the disadvantages
which the colonists suffered through british regulation of their
industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed
still that is somewhat beside the point for mere economic advantage is
not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples a
thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation
to inspire it with a passion for independence and to prepare it for a
destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the british
empire the economists who tried to prove by logic unassailable that
america would be richer under the british flag could not change the
spirit of patrick henry samuel adams benjamin franklin or george
washington

chapter v

the new course in british imperial policy


on october   king george ii died and the british crown passed to
his young grandson the first george the son of the elector of hanover
and sophia the granddaughter of james i was a thorough german who never
even learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned
the second george never saw england until he was a man he spoke english
with an accent and until his death preferred his german home during
their reign the principle had become well established that the king did
not govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in
parliament


george iii and his system

the character of the new kingthe third george rudely broke the
german tradition of his family he resented the imputation that he was a
foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his british sympathies
to the draft of his first speech to parliament he added the popular
phrase born and educated in this country i glory in the name of
briton macaulay the english historian certainly of no liking for
high royal prerogative said of george the young king was a born
englishman all his tastes and habits good and bad were english no
portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with his age
his appearance and all that was known of his character conciliated
public favor he was in the bloom of youth his person and address were
pleasing scandal imputed to him no vice and flattery might without
glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues

nevertheless george iii had been spoiled by his mother his tutors and
his courtiers under their influence he developed high and mighty
notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check
the pretensions of parliament and the ministers dependent upon it his
mother had dinned into his ears the slogan george be king lord
bute his teacher and adviser had told him that his honor required him
to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of
laws thus educated he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged
him in the determination to rule as well as reign to subdue all
parties and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire

george iii

political parties and george iiithe state of the political parties
favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of
the crown the whigs who were composed mainly of the smaller
freeholders merchants inhabitants of towns and protestant
nonconformists had grown haughty and overbearing through long
continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in
their own ranks their opponents the tories had by this time given up
all hope of restoring to the throne the direct stuart line but they
still cherished their old notions about divine right with the
accession of george iii the coveted opportunity came to them to rally
around the throne again george received his tory friends with open
arms gave them offices and bought them seats in the house of commons

the british parliamentary systemthe peculiarities of the british
parliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies
with their designs for controlling the entire government in the first
place the house of lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose
number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites as
of old though the members of the house of commons were elected by
popular vote they did not speak for the mass of english people great
towns like leeds manchester and birmingham for example had no
representatives at all while there were about eight million inhabitants
in great britain there were in  only about  voters that is
to say only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the
government many boroughs returned one or more members to the commons
although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no
voters at all furthermore these tiny boroughs were often controlled by
lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder
the rottenboroughs as they were called by reformers were a public
scandal but george iii readily made use of them to get his friends into
the house of commons


george iiis ministers and their colonial policies

grenville and the war debtwithin a year after the accession of
george iii william pitt was turned out of office the king treating him
with gross incivility and the crowds shouting pitt forever the
direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the kings
confidence leadership in the house of commons fell to george grenville
a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing
cost of government

the first task after the conclusion of peace in  was the adjustment
of the disordered finances of the kingdom the debt stood at the highest
point in the history of the country more revenue was absolutely
necessary and grenville began to search for it turning his attention
finally to the american colonies in this quest he had the aid of a
zealous colleague charles townshend who had long been in public
service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal
governors in america these two men with the support of the entire
ministry inaugurated in february  a new system of colonial
government it was announced by authority that there were to be no more
requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies but
that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of parliament
colonial governors and judges were to be paid by the crown they were to
be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments and all the
expenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation

restriction of paper money among the many complaints filed
before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of
paper money by the colonial legislatures the new ministry provided a
remedy in the act of  which declared void all colonial laws
authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills this
law was aimed at the cheap money which the americans were fond of
making when specie was scarcemoney which they tried to force on their
english creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and
principal of debts thus the first chapter was written in the long
battle over sound money on this continent

limitation on western land saleslater in the same year 
george iii issued a royal proclamation providing among other things
for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of
paris from the french one of the provisions in this royal decree
touched frontiersmen to the quick the contests between the kings
officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had
been long and sharp the americans chafed at restrictions on
settlement the more adventurous were continually moving west and
squatting on land purchased from the indians or simply seized without
authority to put an end to this the king forbade all further purchases
from the indians reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands
and dispose of them for settlement a second provision in the same
proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the indians
including the lucrative fur business in the hands of royal officers in
the colonies these two limitations on american freedom and enterprise
were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the
preservation of the rights of the indians against fraud and abuses

the sugar act of king georges ministers next turned their
attention to measures of taxation and trade since the heavy debt under
which england was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of
america nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition
that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily
upon the english taxpayer the sugar act of  was the result of this
reasoning there was no doubt about the purpose of this law for it was
set forth clearly in the title an act for granting certain duties in
the british colonies and plantations in america  for applying the
produce of such duties  towards defraying the expenses of defending
protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations  and for
more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and
from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the
trade between the same and great britain the old molasses act had been
prohibitive the sugar act of  was clearly intended as a revenue
measure specified duties were laid upon sugar indigo calico silks
and many other commodities imported into the colonies the enforcement
of the molasses act had been utterly neglected but this sugar act had
teeth in it special precautions as to bonds security and
registration of ship masters accompanied by heavy penalties promised
a vigorous execution of the new revenue law

the strict terms of the sugar act were strengthened by administrative
measures under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed
vessels stationed along the american coast were authorized to stop
search and on suspicion seize merchant ships approaching colonial
ports by supplementary orders the entire british official force in
america was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and
navigation laws revenue collectors officers of the army and navy and
royal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty
in the matter of law enforcement the ordinary motives for the discharge
of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice for
naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by
large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties

the stamp act the grenvilletownshend combination moved
steadily towards its goal while the sugar act was under consideration
in parliament grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill the next
year it went through both houses with a speed that must have astounded
its authors the vote in the commons stood  in favor to  against
while in the lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality
of a count as george iii was temporarily insane the measure received
royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency protests of
colonial agents in london were futile we might as well have hindered
the suns progress exclaimed franklin protests of a few opponents in
the commons were equally vain the ministry was firm in its course and
from all appearances the stamp act hardly roused as much as a languid
interest in the city of london in fact it is recorded that the fateful
measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to
act for the king when he was incapacitated

the stamp act like the sugar act declared the purpose of the british
government to raise revenue in america towards defraying the expenses
of defending protecting and securing the british colonies and
plantations in america it was a long measure of more than fifty
sections carefully planned and skillfully drawn by its provisions
duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal
transactionsdeeds mortgages inventories writs bail bondson
licenses to practice law and sell liquor on college diplomas playing
cards dice pamphlets newspapers almanacs calendars and
advertisements the drag net was closely knit for scarcely anything
escaped

the quartering act the ministers were aware that the stamp
act would rouse opposition in americahow great they could not
conjecture while the measure was being debated a friend of general
wolfe colonel barre who knew america well gave them an ominous
warning in the commons believe meremember i this day told you so
he exclaimed the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at
first will accompany them still  a people jealous of their liberties
and who will vindicate them if ever they should be violated the
answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force
preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of
soldiers than usual to the colonies and the ink was hardly dry on the
stamp act when parliament passed the quartering act ordering the
colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce
the new laws we have the power to tax them said one of the ministry
and we will tax them


colonial resistance forces repeal

popular oppositionthe stamp act was greeted in america by an
outburst of denunciation the merchants of the seaboard cities took the
lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest agreeing not to
import british goods while the hated law stood upon the books lawyers
some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others
intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped
papers joined with the merchants aristocratic colonial whigs who had
long grumbled at the administration of royal governors protested
against taxation without their consent as the whigs had done in old
england there were tories however in the colonies as in englandmany
of them of the official classwho denounced the merchants lawyers and
whig aristocrats as seditious factious and republican yet the
opposition to the stamp act and its accompanying measure the quartering
act grew steadily all through the summer of 

in a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the
countryside all through the north and in some of the southern colonies
there sprang up as if by magic committees and societies pledged to
resist the stamp act to the bitter end these popular societies were
known as sons of liberty and daughters of liberty the former including
artisans mechanics and laborers and the latter patriotic women both
groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public
affairs many artisans as well as all the women were excluded from the
right to vote for colonial assemblymen

while the merchants and whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to
drafting wellphrased protests against british measures the sons of
liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures they stirred
up riots in boston new york philadelphia and charleston when attempts
were made to sell the stamps they sacked and burned the residences of
high royal officers they organized committees of inquisition who by
threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of british goods and the use
of stamped papers in fact the sons of liberty carried their operations
to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were
frightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had
unloosed the daughters of liberty in a quieter way were making a very
effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on
domestic industries their own particular province being the manufacture
of clothing and devising substitutes for taxed foods they helped to
feed and clothe their families without buying british goods

legislative action against the stamp actleaders in the colonial
assemblies accustomed to battle against british policies supported the
popular protest the stamp act was signed on march   on may 
the virginia house of burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring
that the general assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes
upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were
illegal unconstitutional and unjust it was in support of these
resolutions that patrick henry uttered the immortal challenge caesar
had his brutus charles i his cromwell and george iii cries of
treason were calmly met by the orator who finished george iii may
profit by their example if that be treason make the most of it

illustration patrick henry

the stamp act congressthe massachusetts assembly answered the call
of virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a congress to
be held in new york to discuss the situation nine colonies responded
and sent representatives the delegates while professing the warmest
affection for the kings person and government firmly spread on record
a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning they
declared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent given
through their respective colonial assemblies that the stamp act showed
a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties that the recent trade
acts were burdensome and grievous and that the right to petition the
king and parliament was their heritage they thereupon made humble
supplication for the repeal of the stamp act

the stamp act congress was more than an assembly of protest it marked
the rise of a new agency of government to express the will of america
it was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the
government of george iii in the colonies it foreshadowed the congress
of the united states under the constitution it was a successful attempt
at union there ought to be no new england men declared christopher
gadsden in the stamp act congress no new yorkers known on the
continent but all of us americans

the repeal of the stamp act and the sugar actthe effect of american
resistance on opinion in england was telling commerce with the colonies
had been effectively boycotted by the americans ships lay idly swinging
at the wharves bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in london
bristol and liverpool workingmen in the manufacturing towns of england
were thrown out of employment the government had sown folly and was
reaping in place of the coveted revenue rebellion

perplexed by the storm they had raised the ministers summoned to the
bar of the house of commons benjamin franklin the agent for
pennsylvania who was in london do you think it right asked
grenville that america should be protected by this country and pay no
part of the expenses the answer was brief that is not the case the
colonies raised clothed and paid during the last war twentyfive
thousand men and spent many millions then came an inquiry whether the
colonists would accept a modified stamp act no never replied
franklin never they will never submit to it it was next suggested
that military force might compel obedience to law franklin had a ready
answer they cannot force a man to take stamps they may not find a
rebellion they may indeed make one

the repeal of the stamp act was moved in the house of commons a few days
later the sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted debts
due british merchants placed in jeopardy manchester industries closed
workingmen unemployed oppression instituted and the loss of the
colonies threatened pitt and edmund burke the former near the close
of his career the latter just beginning his argued cogently in favor
of retracing the steps taken the year before grenville refused
america must learn he wailed that prayers are not to be brought to
caesar through riot and sedition his protests were idle the commons
agreed to the repeal on february   amid the cheers of the
victorious majority it was carried through the lords in the face of
strong opposition and on march  reluctantly signed by the king now
restored to his right mind

in rescinding the stamp act parliament did not admit the contention of
the americans that it was without power to tax them on the contrary it
accompanied the repeal with a declaratory act it announced that the
colonies were subordinate to the crown and parliament of great britain
that the king and parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make
laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever and that the
resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were
null and void

the repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular
demonstrations bells were rung toasts to the king were drunk and
trade resumed its normal course the declaratory act as a mere paper
resolution did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered
the name of king george their confidence was soon strengthened by the
news that even the sugar act had been repealed thus practically
restoring the condition of affairs before grenville and townshend
inaugurated their policy of thoroughness


resumption of british revenue and commercial policies

the townshend acts the triumph of the colonists was brief
though pitt the friend of america was once more prime minister and
seated in the house of lords as the earl of chatham his severe illness
gave to townshend and the tory party practical control over parliament
unconvinced by the experience with the stamp act townshend brought
forward and pushed through both houses of parliament three measures
which to this day are associated with his name first among his
restrictive laws was that of june   which placed the enforcement
of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports
in the hands of british commissioners appointed by the king resident in
the colonies paid from the british treasury and independent of all
control by the colonists the second measure of the same date imposed a
tax on lead glass paint tea and a few other articles imported into
the colonies the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward
the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial
officials a third measure was the tea act of july   aimed at the
tea trade which the americans carried on illegally with foreigners this
law abolished the duty which the east india company had to pay in
england on tea exported to america for it was thought that english tea
merchants might thus find it possible to undersell american tea
smugglers

writs of assistance legalized by parliamenthad parliament been
content with laying duties just as a manifestation of power and right
and neglected their collection perhaps little would have been heard of
the townshend acts it provided however for the strict even the
harsh enforcement of the law it ordered customs officers to remain at
their posts and put an end to smuggling in the revenue act of june 
 it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to
issue writs of assistance empowering customs officers to enter any
house warehouse shop cellar or other place in the british colonies
or plantations in america to search for and seize prohibited or
smuggled goods

the writ of assistance which was a general search warrant issued to
revenue officers was an ancient device hateful to a people who
cherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual
gains in the practice of civil liberty to allow a minion of the law
to enter a mans house and search his papers and premises was too much
for the emotions of people who had fled to america in a quest for
selfgovernment and free homes who had braved such hardships to
establish them and who wanted to trade without official interference

the writ of assistance had been used in massachusetts in  to prevent
illicit trade with canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that
time in  it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which
arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a
massachusetts court for writs of assistance as usual this application
was vainly opposed by james otis in a speech of five hours durationa
speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it
away ready to take up arms against writs of assistance otis denounced
the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king
his head and another his throne a tyrants device which placed the
liberty of every man in jeopardy enabling any petty officer to work
possible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion and to
spread terror and desolation through the land what a scene he
exclaimed does this open every man prompted by revenge illhumor
or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbors house may get a
writ of assistance others will ask it from selfdefense one arbitrary
exertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and
blood he did more than attack the writ itself he said that parliament
could not establish it because it was against the british constitution
this was an assertion resting on slender foundation but it was quickly
echoed by the people then and there james otis sounded the call to
america to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers
then and there wrote john adams the child independence was born
such was the hated writ that townshend proposed to put into the hands of
customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law

the new york assembly suspendedin the very month that townshends
acts were signed by the king parliament took a still more drastic step
the assembly of new york protesting against the ruinous and
insupportable expense involved had failed to make provision for the
care of british troops in accordance with the terms of the quartering
act parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to
obey the law it was not until a third election was held that compliance
with the quartering act was wrung from the reluctant province in the
meantime all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their
representative bodies rested


renewed resistance in america

the massachusetts circular massachusetts under the
leadership of samuel adams resolved to resist the policy of renewed
intervention in america at his suggestion the assembly adopted a
circular letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies
informing them of the state of affairs in massachusetts and roundly
condemning the whole british program the circular letter declared that
parliament had no right to lay taxes on americans without their consent
and that the colonists could not from the nature of the case be
represented in parliament it went on shrewdly to submit to
consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free
who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and
paid out of funds raised independently it invited the other colonies
in the most temperate tones to take thought about the common
predicament in which they were all placed

illustration from an old print

samuel adams

the dissolution of assembliesthe governor of massachusetts hearing
of the circular letter ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal on
meeting refusal he promptly dissolved it the maryland georgia and
south carolina assemblies indorsed the circular letter and were also
dissolved at once the virginia house of burgesses thoroughly aroused
passed resolutions on may   declaring that the sole right of
imposing taxes in virginia was vested in its legislature asserting anew
the right of petition to the crown condemning the transportation of
persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas and beseeching the
king for a redress of the general grievances the immediate dissolution
of the virginia assembly in its turn was the answer of the royal
governor

the boston massacreamerican opposition to the british authorities
kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved the houses of
citizens searched and troops distributed in increasing numbers among
the centers of discontent merchants again agreed not to import british
goods the sons of liberty renewed their agitation and women set about
the patronage of home products still more loyally

on the night of march   a crowd on the streets of boston began to
jostle and tease some british regulars stationed in the town things
went from bad to worse until some boys and young fellows began to
throw snowballs and stones then the exasperated soldiers fired into the
crowd killing five and wounding half a dozen more the day after the
massacre a mass meeting was held in the town and samuel adams was
sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers the governor hesitated
and tried to compromise finding adams relentless the governor yielded
and ordered the regulars away

the boston massacre stirred the country from new hampshire to georgia
popular passions ran high the guilty soldiers were charged with murder
their defense was undertaken in spite of the wrath of the populace by
john adams and josiah quincy who as lawyers thought even the worst

offenders entitled to their full rights in law in his speech to the
jury however adams warned the british government against its course
saying that from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous
town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one two of
the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished

resistance in the souththe year following the boston massacre some
citizens of north carolina goaded by the conduct of the royal governor
openly resisted his authority many were killed as a result and seven
who were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors a little later royal
troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near alamance river
called the lexington of the south

the gaspee affair and the virginia resolutions of on sea as
well as on land friction between the royal officers and the colonists
broke out into overt acts while patrolling narragansett bay looking for
smugglers one day in  the armed ship gaspee ran ashore and was
caught fast during the night several men from providence boarded the
vessel and after seizing the crew set it on fire a royal commission
sent to rhode island to discover the offenders and bring them to
account failed because it could not find a single informer the very
appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of virginia to
action and in march  the house of burgesses passed a resolution
creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation
among the colonies in resistance to british measures

the boston tea partyalthough the british government finding the
townshend revenue act a failure repealed in  all the duties except
that on tea it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other
commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies moreover
parliament decided to relieve the british east india company of the
financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the
tea act and the colonial boycott that followed in  it agreed to
return to the company the regular import duties levied in england on
all tea transshipped to america a small impost of three pence to be
collected in america was left as a reminder of the principle laid down
in the declaratory act that parliament had the right to tax the
colonists

this arrangement with the east india company was obnoxious to the
colonists for several reasons it was an act of favoritism for one
thing in the interest of a great monopoly for another thing it
promised to dump on the american market suddenly an immense amount of
cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to american merchants who had large
stocks on hand it threatened with ruin the business of all those who
were engaged in clandestine trade with the dutch it carried with it an
irritating tax of three pence on imports in charleston annapolis new
york and boston captains of ships who brought tea under this act were
roughly handled one night in december  a band of boston citizens
disguised as indians boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo
into the harbor this was serious business for it was open flagrant
determined violation of the law as such the british government viewed
it


retaliation by the british government

reception of the news of the tea riotthe news of the tea riot in
boston confirmed king george in his conviction that there should be no
soft policy in dealing with his american subjects the die is cast he
stated with evident satisfaction the colonies must either triumph or
submit if we take the resolute part they will undoubtedly be very
meek lord george germain characterized the tea party as the
proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought if they had
the least prudence to follow their mercantile employments and not
trouble themselves with politics and government which they do not
understand this expressed in concise form exactly the sentiments of
lord north who had then for three years been the kings chief minister
even pitt lord chatham was prepared to support the government in
upholding its authority

the five intolerable actsparliament beginning on march  
passed five stringent measures known in american history as the five
intolerable acts they were aimed at curing the unrest in america the
first of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of boston to
commerce with the outside world the second following closely
revoked the massachusetts charter of  and provided furthermore that
the councilors should be appointed by the king that all judges should
be named by the royal governor and that town meetings except to elect
certain officers could not be held without the governors consent a
third measure after denouncing the utter subversion of all lawful
government in the provinces authorized royal agents to transfer to
great britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other
persons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law
the fourth act legalized the quartering of troops in massachusetts
towns the fifth of the measures was the quebec act which granted
religious toleration to the catholics in canada extended the boundaries
of quebec southward to the ohio river and established in this western
region government by a viceroy

the intolerable acts went through parliament with extraordinary
celerity there was an opposition alert and informed but it was
ineffective burke spoke eloquently against the boston port bill
condemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty and
showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train he
was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected the bill passed both
houses without a division the entry unanimous being made upon their
journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion
the law destroying the charter of massachusetts passed the commons by a
vote of three to one and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to
one the triumph of the ministry was complete what passed in boston
exclaimed the great jurist lord mansfield is the overt act of high
treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight the
crown and parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures

in the colonies the laws were received with consternation to the
american protestants the quebec act was the most offensive that
project they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct
attempt to enlist french canadians on the side of great britain the
british government did not grant religious toleration to catholics
either at home or in ireland and the americans could see no good motive
in granting it in north america the act was also offensive because
massachusetts connecticut and virginia had under their charters
large claims in the territory thus annexed to quebec

to enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the british
government was brought into play the commanderinchief of the armed
forces in america general gage was appointed governor of
massachusetts reinforcements were brought to the colonies for now king
george was to give the rebels as he called them a taste of strong
medicine the majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force


from reform to revolution in america

the doctrine of natural rightsthe dissolution of assemblies the
destruction of charters and the use of troops produced in the colonies
a new phase in the struggle in the early days of the contest with the
british ministry the americans spoke of their rights as englishmen
and condemned the acts of parliament as unlawful as violating the
principles of the english constitution under which they all lived when
they saw that such arguments had no effect on parliament they turned
for support to their natural rights the latter doctrine in the form
in which it was employed by the colonists was as english as the
constitutional argument john locke had used it with good effect in
defense of the english revolution in the seventeenth century american
leaders familiar with the writings of locke also took up his thesis in
the hour of their distress they openly declared that their rights did
not rest after all upon the english constitution or a charter from the
crown old magna carta was not the beginning of all things retorted
otis when the constitutional argument failed a time may come when
parliament shall declare every american charter void but the natural
inherent and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens
would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished
until the general conflagration of the same opinion was the young and
impetuous alexander hamilton the sacred rights of mankind he
exclaimed are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty
records they are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human
destiny by the hand of divinity itself and can never be erased or
obscured by mortal power

firm as the american leaders were in the statement and defense of their
rights there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they
hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion they constantly
avowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest
language against his policies even otis regarded by the loyalists as a
firebrand was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning
concessions from england i argue this cause with the greater
pleasure he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of
assistance as it is in favor of british liberty  and as it is in
opposition to a kind of power the exercise of which in former periods
cost one king of england his head and another his throne

burke offers the doctrine of conciliationthe flooding tide of
american sentiment was correctly measured by one englishman at least
edmund burke who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of
american democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature he
saw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the american
spirithow inevitable how irresistible he warned his countrymen that
there were three ways of handling the delicate situationand only
three one was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of
the colonistsan utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded
in the essential circumstances of american life the second was to
prosecute american leaders as criminals of this he begged his
countrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that a government
against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a
government to which submission is equivalent to slavery the third and
right way to meet the problem burke concluded was to accept the
american spirit repeal the obnoxious measures and receive the colonies
into equal partnership

events produce the great decisionthe right way indicated by burke
was equally impossible to george iii and the majority in parliament to
their narrow minds american opinion was contemptible and american
resistance unlawful riotous and treasonable the correct way in their
view was to dispatch more troops to crush the rebels and that very
act took the contest from the realm of opinion as john adams said
facts are stubborn things opinions were unseen but marching soldiers
were visible to the veriest street urchin now said gouverneur
morris the sheep simple as they are cannot be gulled as heretofore
it was too late to talk about the excellence of the british
constitution if any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern
historians as to why the crisis came at last he can clarify his
understanding by reading again edmund burkes stately oration on
conciliation with america

the american revolution


resistance and retaliation

the continental congresswhen the news of the intolerable acts
reached america every one knew what strong medicine parliament was
prepared to administer to all those who resisted its authority the
cause of massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies opposition
to british policy hitherto local and spasmodic now took on a national
character to local committees and provincial conventions was added a
continental congress appropriately called by massachusetts on june 
 at the instigation of samuel adams the response to the summons
was electric by hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected
during the summer and on september  the congress duly assembled in
carpenters hall in philadelphia many of the greatest men in america
were theregeorge washington and patrick henry from virginia and john
and samuel adams from massachusetts every shade of opinion was
represented some were impatient with mild devices the majority favored
moderation

the congress drew up a declaration of american rights and stated in
clear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists it
approved the resistance to british measures offered by massachusetts and
promised the united support of all sections it prepared an address to
king george and another to the people of england disavowing the idea of
independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the british
government

the nonimportation agreementthe congress was not content however
with professions of faith and with petitions it took one revolutionary
step it agreed to stop the importation of british goods into america
and the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local
committees of safety and inspection to be elected by the qualified
voters the significance of this action is obvious congress threw
itself athwart british law it made a rule to bind american citizens and
to be carried into effect by american officers it set up a state within
the british state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order
the colonists who up to this moment had been wavering had to choose
one authority or the other they were for the enforcement of the
nonimportation agreement or they were against it they either bought
english goods or they did not in the spirit of the toastmay britain
be wise and america be freethe first continental congress adjourned
in october having appointed the tenth of may following for the meeting
of a second congress should necessity require

lord norths olive branchwhen the news of the action of the
american congress reached england pitt and burke warmly urged a repeal
of the obnoxious laws but in vain all they could wring from the prime
minister lord north was a set of conciliatory resolutions proposing
to relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of
imperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of
the crown this olive branch was accompanied by a resolution assuring
the king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by
the restraining act of march   which in effect destroyed the
commerce of new england

bloodshed at lexington and concord april  meanwhile the
british authorities in massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in
upholding british sovereignty general gage hearing that military
stores had been collected at concord dispatched a small force to seize
them by this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid
at lexington on the road to concord occurred the little thing that
produced the great event an unexpected collision beyond the thought
or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the
battle field

the second continental congressthough blood had been shed and war
was actually at hand the second continental congress which met at
philadelphia in may  was not yet convinced that conciliation was
beyond human power it petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the
colonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil
war on the last day of july it made a temperate but firm answer to
lord norths offer of conciliation stating that the proposal was
unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal
the offensive acts of parliament

force the british answerjust as the representatives of america
were about to present the last petition of congress to the king on
august   george iii issued a proclamation of rebellion this
announcement declared that the colonists misled by dangerous and
illdesigning men were in a state of insurrection it called on the
civil and military powers to bring the traitors to justice and it
threatened with condign punishment the authors perpetrators and
abettors of such traitorous designs it closed with the usual prayer
god save the king later in the year parliament passed a sweeping
act destroying all trade and intercourse with america congress was
silent at last force was also americas answer


american independence

drifting into waralthough the congress had not given up all hope of
reconciliation in the spring and summer of  it had firmly resolved
to defend american rights by arms if necessary it transformed the
militiamen who had assembled near boston after the battle of lexington
into a continental army and selected washington as commanderinchief
it assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money wage
war and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries

illustration from an old print

spirit of 

events followed thick and fast on june  the american militia by
the stubborn defense of bunker hill showed that it could make british
regulars pay dearly for all they got on july  washington took command
of the army at cambridge in january  after bitter disappointments
in drumming up recruits for its army in england scotland and ireland
the british government concluded a treaty with the landgrave of
hessecassel in germany contracting at a handsome figure for thousands
of soldiers and many pieces of cannon this was the crowning insult to
america such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides
of the water such was long afterward the judgment of the conservative
historian lecky the conduct of england in hiring german mercenaries to
subdue the essentially english population beyond the atlantic made
reconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable the news of this
wretched transaction in german soldiers had hardly reached america
before there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that washington
had taken boston on march   compelling lord howe to sail with
his entire army for halifax

the growth of public sentiment in favor of independenceevents were
bearing the americans away from their old position under the british
constitution toward a final separation slowly and against their
desires prudent and honorable men who cherished the ties that united
them to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of
revolution were drawn into the path that led to the great decision in
all parts of the country and among all classes the question of the hour
was being debated american independence as the historian bancroft
says was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one
assembly it had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers
and merchants by mechanics and planters by the fishermen along the
coast and the backwoodsmen of the west in town meetings and from the
pulpit at social gatherings and around the camp fires in county
conventions and conferences or committees in colonial congresses and
assemblies

thomas paine

paines commonsensein the midst of this ferment of american
opinion a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating
public with a program for absolute independence without fears and
without apologies in the early days of  thomas paine issued the
first of his famous tracts commonsense a passionate attack upon the
british monarchy and an equally passionate plea for american liberty
casting aside the language of petition with which americans had hitherto
addressed george iii paine went to the other extreme and assailed him
with many a violent epithet he condemned monarchy itself as a system
which had laid the world in blood and ashes instead of praising the
british constitution under which colonists had been claiming their
rights he brushed it aside as ridiculous protesting that it was owing
to the constitution of the people not to the constitution of the
government that the crown is not as oppressive in england as in
turkey

having thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old
order paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate
separation from great britain there was nothing in the sphere of
practical interest he insisted which should bind the colonies to the
mother country allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars
in which they had been involved reasons of trade were not less weighty
in behalf of independence our corn will fetch its price in any market
in europe and our imported goods must be paid for buy them where we
will as to matters of government it is not in the power of britain
to do this continent justice the business of it will soon be too
weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of
convenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us

there is accordingly no alternative to independence for america
everything that is right or natural pleads for separation the blood of
the slain the weeping voice of nature cries tis time to part 
arms the last resort must decide the contest the appeal was the
choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge the
sun never shone on a cause of greater worth tis not the affair of a
city a county a province or a kingdom but of a continent tis not
the concern of a day a year or an age posterity is involved in the
contest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the
proceedings now now is the seedtime of continental union faith and
honor o ye that love mankind ye that dare oppose not only the
tyranny but the tyrant stand forth let names of whig and tory be
extinct let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen
an open and resolute friend and a virtuous supporter of the rights of
mankind and of the free and independent states of america as more than
 copies were scattered broadcast over the country patriots
exclaimed with washington sound doctrine and unanswerable reason

the drift of events toward independenceofficial support for the
idea of independence began to come from many quarters on the tenth of
february  gadsden in the provincial convention of south carolina
advocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence
for all america the convention balked at the latter but went half way
by abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a
complete plan of selfgovernment a month later on april  the
neighboring state of north carolina uttered the daring phrase from which
others shrank it empowered its representatives in the congress to
concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring
independence rhode island massachusetts and virginia quickly
responded to the challenge the convention of the old dominion on may
 instructed its delegates at philadelphia to propose the independence
of the united colonies and to give the assent of virginia to the act of
separation when the resolution was carried the british flag on the
state house was lowered for all time

meanwhile the continental congress was alive to the course of events
outside the subject of independence was constantly being raised are
we rebels exclaimed wyeth of virginia during a debate in february
no we must declare ourselves a free people others hesitated and
spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation is
not america already independent asked samuel adams a few weeks later
why not then declare it still there was uncertainty and delegates
avoided the direct word a few more weeks elapsed at last on may 
congress declared that the authority of the british crown in america
must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of
their own

thomas jefferson reading his draft of the declaration of
independence to the committee of congress

independence declaredthe way was fully prepared therefore when
on june  the virginia delegation in the congress moved that these
united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent
states a committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal
document setting forth the reasons for the act and on july  all the
states save new york went on record in favor of severing their political
connection with great britain two days later july  jeffersons draft
of the declaration of independence changed in some slight particulars
was adopted the old bell in independence hall as it is now known rang
out the glad tidings couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost
hamlet and farm a new nation announced its will to have a place among
the powers of the world

to some documents is given immortality the declaration of independence
is one of them american patriotism is forever associated with it but
patriotism alone does not make it immortal neither does the vigor of
its language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in
the records of time the secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact
that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political
ideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading
throughout the earth challenging kings and potentates shaking down
thrones and aristocracies breaking the armies of irresponsible power on
battle fields as far apart as marston moor and chateauthierry that
ideal now so familiar then so novel is summed up in the simple
sentence governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed

written in a decent respect for the opinions of mankind to set forth
the causes which impelled the american colonists to separate from
britain the declaration contained a long list of abuses and
usurpations which had induced them to throw off the government of king
george that section of the declaration has passed into ancient
history and is seldom read it is the part laying down a new basis for
government and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a
household phrase in the old world as in the new

in the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which
from the standpoint of the old system of government were the essence of
revolution  all men are created equal and are endowed by their
creator with certain unalienable rights including life liberty and the
pursuit of happiness  the purpose of government is to secure these
rights  governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed  whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and
institute new government laying its foundations on such principles and
organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to
effect their safety and happiness here was the prelude to the historic
drama of democracya challenge to every form of government and every
privilege not founded on popular assent


the establishment of government and the new allegiance

the committees of correspondenceas soon as debate had passed into
armed resistance the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their
forces by organizing civil government this was readily effected for
the means were at hand in town meetings provincial legislatures and
committees of correspondence the working tools of the revolution were
in fact the committees of correspondencesmall local unofficial
groups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment
as early as november  such a committee had been created in boston
under the leadership of samuel adams it held regular meetings sent
emissaries to neighboring towns and carried on a campaign of education
in the doctrines of liberty

illustration the colonies of north america at the time of the
declaration of independence

upon local organizations similar in character to the boston committee
were built county committees and then the larger colonial committees
congresses and conventions all unofficial and representing the
revolutionary elements ordinarily the provincial convention was merely
the old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and
controlled by patriots finally upon these colonial assemblies was
built the continental congress the precursor of union under the
articles of confederation and ultimately under the constitution of the
united states this was the revolutionary government set up within the
british empire in america

state constitutions framedwith the rise of these new assemblies of
the people the old colonial governments broke down from the royal
provinces the governor the judges and the high officers fled in haste
and it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities the appeal to
the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for
themselves issued by the congress in may  was quickly acted upon
before the expiration of a year virginia new jersey pennsylvania
delaware maryland georgia and new york had drafted new constitutions
as states not as colonies uncertain of their destinies connecticut and
rhode island holding that their ancient charters were equal to their
needs merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as
before so far as the form of government was concerned south carolina
which had drafted a temporary plan early in  drew up a new and more
complete constitution in  two years later massachusetts with much
deliberation put into force its fundamental law which in most of its
essential features remains unchanged today

the new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial
models for the royal governor was substituted a governor or president
chosen usually by the legislature but in two instances new york and
massachusetts by popular vote for the provincial council there was
substituted except in georgia a senate while the lower house or
assembly was continued virtually without change the old property
restriction on the suffrage though lowered slightly in some states was
continued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus
deprived of the ballot the special qualifications laid down in several
constitutions for governors senators and representatives indicated
that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical
experiments in democracy the protests of a few women like mrs john
adams of massachusetts and mrs henry corbin of virginia against a
government which excluded them from political rights were treated as
mild curiosities of no significance although in new jersey women were
allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men

by the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power of
authority derived from any source save the people were swept aside
and republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first
time to the modern world copies of these remarkable documents prepared
by plain citizens were translated into french and widely circulated in
europe there they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to
a generation of constitutionmakers whose mission it was to begin the
democratic revolution in the old world

the articles of confederationthe formation of state constitutions
was an easy task for the revolutionary leaders they had only to build
on foundations already laid the establishment of a national system of
government was another matter there had always been it must be
remembered a system of central control over the colonies but americans
had had little experience in its operation when the supervision of the
crown of great britain was suddenly broken the patriot leaders
accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship were poorly trained for
action on a national stage

many forces worked against those who like franklin had a vision of
national destiny there were differences in economic interestcommerce
and industry in the north and the planting system of the south there
were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops
for common defense to these practical difficulties were added local
pride the vested rights of state and village politicians in their
provincial dignity and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon
the common enterprise

nevertheless necessity compelled them to consider some sort of
federation the second continental congress had hardly opened its work
before the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a
permanent connection as early as july  congress resolved to go
into a committee of the whole on the state of the union and franklin
undaunted by the fate of his albany plan of twenty years before again
presented a draft of a constitution long and desultory debates followed
and it was not until late in  that congress presented to the states
the articles of confederation provincial jealousies delayed
ratification and it was the spring of  a few months before the
surrender of cornwallis at yorktown when maryland the last of the
states approved the articles this plan of union though it was all
that could be wrung from the reluctant states provided for neither a
chief executive nor a system of federal courts it created simply a
congress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it
the right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of
governmentmoney and soldiers

the application of tests of allegianceas the successive steps were
taken in the direction of independent government the patriots devised
and applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against
the new nation in the process of making when the first continental
congress agreed not to allow the importation of british goods it
provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules such
agencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme all
opponents being excluded from the elections before these bodies those
who persisted in buying british goods were summoned and warned or
punished according to circumstances as soon as the new state
constitutions were put into effect local committees set to work in the
same way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of
the new order of things

illustration mobbing the tories

these patriot agencies bearing different names in different sections
were sometimes ruthless in their methods they called upon all men to
sign the test of loyalty frequently known as the association test
those who refused were promptly branded as outlaws while some of the
more dangerous were thrown into jail the prison camp in connecticut at
one time held the former governor of new jersey and the mayor of new
york thousands were blacklisted and subjected to espionage the
blacklist of pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred
persons of prominence who were under suspicion loyalists or tories who
were bold enough to speak and write against the revolution were
suppressed and their pamphlets burned in many places particularly in
the north the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the
proceeds applied to the cause of the revolution

the work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was
sometimes supplemented by mob violence a few tories were hanged without
trial and others were tarred and feathered one was placed upon a cake
of ice and held there until his loyalty to king george might cool
whole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best
they could within the british lines or into canada where the british
government gave them lands such excesses were deplored by washington
but they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war as well
as a war for independence was being waged

the patriots and toriesthus by one process or another those who
were to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who
preferred to be subjects of king george just what proportion of the
americans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the
british monarchy there is no way of knowing the question of revolution
was not submitted to popular vote and on the point of numbers we have
conflicting evidence on the patriot side there is the testimony of a
careful and informed observer john adams who asserted that twothirds
of the people were for the american cause and not more than onethird
opposed the revolution at all stages

on behalf of the loyalists or tories as they were popularly known
extravagant claims were made joseph galloway who had been a member of
the first continental congress and had fled to england when he saw its
temper testified before a committee of parliament in  that not
onefifth of the american people supported the insurrection and that
many more than fourfifths of the people prefer a union with great
britain upon constitutional principles to independence at the same
time general robertson who had lived in america twentyfour years
declared that more than twothirds of the people would prefer the
kings government to the congress tyranny in an address to the king
in that year a committee of american loyalists asserted that the number
of americans in his majestys army exceeded the number of troops
enlisted by congress to oppose them

the character of the loyalistswhen general howe evacuated boston
more than a thousand people fled with him this great company according
to a careful historian formed the aristocracy of the province by
virtue of their official rank of their dignified callings and
professions of their hereditary wealth and of their culture the act
of banishment passed by massachusetts in  listing over  tories
reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of
new england more than one out of five being graduates of harvard
college the same was true of new york and philadelphia namely that
the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order
clergymen and wealthy merchants with passion the loyalists fought
against the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees
for a life of uncertainty in canada or the mother country

tories assail the patriotsthe tories who remained in america joined
the british army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal
cause those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in
editorials rhymes satires and political catechisms they declared
that the members of congress were obscure pettifogging attorneys
bankrupt shopkeepers outlawed smugglers etc the people and their
leaders they characterized as wretched banditti  the refuse and
dregs of mankind the generals in the army they sneered at as men of
rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the congress

patriot writers arouse the national spiritstung by tory taunts
patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public
opinion favorable to the american cause moreover they had to combat
the depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the
war a terrible disaster befell generals arnold and montgomery in the
winter of  as they attempted to bring canada into the revolutiona
disaster that cost  men repeated calamities harassed washington in
 as he was defeated on long island driven out of new york city and
beaten at harlem heights and white plains these reverses were almost
too great for the stoutest patriots

pamphleteers preachers and publicists rose however to meet the needs
of the hour john witherspoon provost of the college of new jersey
forsook the classroom for the field of political controversy the poet
philip freneau flung taunts of cowardice at the tories and celebrated
the spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem songs ballads plays
and satires flowed from the press in an unending stream fast days
battle anniversaries celebrations of important steps taken by congress
afforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons
does mr wiberd preach against oppression anxiously inquired john
adams in a letter to his wife the answer was decisive the clergy of
every denomination not excepting the episcopalian thunder and lighten
every sabbath they pray for boston and massachusetts they thank god
most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes they pray
for the american army

thomas paine never let his pen rest he had been with the forces of
washington when they retreated from fort lee and were harried from new
jersey into pennsylvania he knew the effect of such reverses on the
army as well as on the public in december  he made a second great
appeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet the crisis the first part
of which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him this
tract was a cry for continued support of the revolution these are the
times that try mens souls he opened the summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his
country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men
and women paine laid his lash fiercely on the tories branding every
one as a coward grounded in servile slavish selfinterested fear he
deplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army he
refuted the charge that the retreat through new jersey was a disaster
and he promised victory soon by perseverance and fortitude he
concluded we have the prospect of a glorious issue by cowardice and
submission the sad choice of a variety of evilsa ravaged country a
depopulated city habitations without safety and slavery without
hope look on this picture and weep over it his ringing call to
arms was followed by another and another until the long contest was
over


military affairs

the two phases of the warthe war which opened with the battle of
lexington on april   and closed with the surrender of
cornwallis at yorktown on october   passed through two distinct
phasesthe first lasting until the treaty of alliance with france in
 and the second until the end of the struggle during the first
phase the war was confined mainly to the north the outstanding
features of the contest were the evacuation of boston by the british
the expulsion of american forces from new york and their retreat through
new jersey the battle of trenton the seizure of philadelphia by the
british september  the invasion of new york by burgoyne and his
capture at saratoga in october  and the encampment of american
forces at valley forge for the terrible winter of 

the final phase of the war opening with the treaty of alliance with
france on february   was confined mainly to the middle states
the west and the south in the first sphere of action the chief events
were the withdrawal of the british from philadelphia the battle of
monmouth and the inclosure of the british in new york by deploying
american forces from morristown new jersey up to west point in the
west george rogers clark by his famous march into the illinois
country secured kaskaskia and vincennes and laid a firm grip on the
country between the ohio and the great lakes in the south the second
period opened with successes for the british they captured savannah
conquered georgia and restored the royal governor in  they seized
charleston administered a crushing defeat to the american forces under
gates at camden and overran south carolina though meeting reverses at
cowpens and kings mountain then came the closing scenes cornwallis
began the last of his operations he pursued general greene far into
north carolina clashed with him at guilford court house retired to the
coast took charge of british forces engaged in plundering virginia and
fortified yorktown where he was penned up by the french fleet from the
sea and the combined french and american forces on land

the geographical aspects of the warfor the british the theater of
the war offered many problems from first to last it extended from
massachusetts to georgia a distance of almost a thousand miles it was
nearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and though
the british navy kept the channel open transports were constantly
falling prey to daring privateers and fleet american war vessels the
sea on the other hand offered an easy means of transportation between
points along the coast and gave ready access to the american centers of
wealth and population of this the british made good use though early
forced to give up boston they seized new york and kept it until the end
of the war they took philadelphia and retained it until threatened by
the approach of the french fleet and they captured and held both
savannah and charleston wars however are seldom won by the conquest
of cities

particularly was this true in the case of the revolution only a small
portion of the american people lived in towns countrymen back from the
coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood they lived on
the produce of the soil not upon the profits of trade this very fact
gave strength to them in the contest whenever the british ventured far
from the ports of entry they encountered reverses burgoyne was forced
to surrender at saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his
base of supplies as soon as the british got away from charleston they
were harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of marion sumter
and pickens cornwallis could technically defeat greene at guilford far
in the interior but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded
sustained by their own labor possessing the interior to which their
armies could readily retreat supplied mainly from native resources the
americans could not be hemmed in penned up and destroyed at one fell
blow

the sea powerthe british made good use of their fleet in cutting
off american trade but control of the sea did not seriously affect the
united states as an agricultural country the ruin of its commerce was
not such a vital matter all the materials for a comfortable though
somewhat rude life were right at hand it made little difference to a
nation fighting for existence if silks fine linens and chinaware were
cut off this was an evil to which submission was necessary

nor did the brilliant exploits of john paul jones and captain john barry
materially change the situation they demonstrated the skill of american
seamen and their courage as fighting men they raised the rates of
british marine insurance but they did not dethrone the mistress of the
seas less spectacular and more distinctive were the deeds of the
hundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled british supply
ships and kept british merchantmen in constant anxiety not until the
french fleet was thrown into the scale were the british compelled to
reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the
possibilities of a maritime disaster

commanding officerson the score of military leadership it is
difficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest
there is no doubt that all the british commanders were men of experience
in the art of warfare sir william howe had served in america during the
french war and was accounted an excellent officer a strict
disciplinarian and a gallant gentleman nevertheless he loved ease
society and good living and his expulsion from boston his failure to
overwhelm washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at new york
and philadelphia destroyed every shred of his military reputation john
burgoyne to whom was given the task of penetrating new york from
canada had likewise seen service in the french war both in america and
europe he had however a touch of the theatrical in his nature and
after the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 
he devoted his time mainly to light literature sir henry clinton who
directed the movement which ended in the capture of charleston in 
had learned his trade on the continent and was regarded as a man of
discretion and understanding in military matters lord cornwallis whose
achievements at camden and guilford were blotted out by his surrender at
yorktown had seen service in the seven years war and had undoubted
talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in
india though none of them perhaps were men of firstrate ability
they all had training and experience to guide them

illustration george washington

the americans had a host in washington himself he had long been
interested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire
during the first clashes with the french nearly twenty years before he
had no doubts about the justice of his cause such as plagued some of
the british generals he was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian he
was reserved and patient little given to exaltation at success or
depression at reverses in the dark hour of the revolution what held
the patriot forces together asks beveridge in his life of john
marshall then he answers george washington and he alone had he
died or been seriously disabled the revolution would have ended
washington was the soul of the american cause washington was the
government washington was the revolution the weakness of congress in
furnishing men and supplies the indolence of civilians who lived at
ease while the army starved the intrigues of army officers against him
such as the conway cabal the cowardice of lee at monmouth even the
treason of benedict arnold while they stirred deep emotions in his
breast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen did
not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through
to the bitter end the weight of washingtons moral force was
immeasurable

of the generals who served under him none can really be said to have
been experienced military men when the war opened benedict arnold the
unhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier was a druggist book
seller and ship owner at new haven when the news of lexington called
him to battle horatio gates was looked upon as a seasoned soldier
because he had entered the british army as a youth had been wounded at
braddocks memorable defeat and had served with credit during the seven
years war but he was the most conspicuous failure of the revolution
the triumph over burgoyne was the work of other men and his crushing
defeat at camden put an end to his military pretensions nathanael
greene was a rhode island farmer and smith without military experience
who when convinced that war was coming read caesars commentaries and
took up the sword francis marion was a shy and modest planter of south
carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush
with the indians ten or twelve years earlier daniel morgan one of the
heroes of cowpens had been a teamster with braddocks army and had seen
some fighting during the french and indian war but his military
knowledge from the point of view of a trained british officer was
negligible john sullivan was a successful lawyer at durham new
hampshire and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to
lay down his briefs and take up the sword anthony wayne was a
pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who on hearing the clash of arms
read a few books on war raised a regiment and offered himself for
service such is the story of the chief american military leaders and
it is typical of them all some had seen fighting with the french and
indians but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular
troops commanded according to the strategy evolved in european
experience courage native ability quickness of mind and knowledge of
the country they had in abundance and in battles such as were fought
during the revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the
balance

foreign officers in american serviceto native genius was added
military talent from beyond the seas baron steuben well schooled in
the iron regime of frederick the great came over from prussia joined
washington at valley forge and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the
men laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular
soldiers from france came young lafayette and the stern de kalb from
poland came pulaski and kosciuskoall acquainted with the arts of war
as waged in europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching
lafayette came early in  in a ship of his own accompanied by
several officers of wide experience and remained loyally throughout the
war sharing the hardships of american army life pulaski fell at the
siege of savannah and de kalb at camden kosciusko survived the american
war to defend in vain the independence of his native land to these
distinguished foreigners who freely threw in their lot with american
revolutionary fortunes was due much of that spirit and discipline which
fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military
power of the first rank

the soldiersas far as the british soldiers were concerned their
annals are short and simple the regulars from the standing army who
were sent over at the opening of the contest the recruits drummed up
by special efforts at home and the thousands of hessians bought
outright by king george presented few problems of management to the
british officers these common soldiers were far away from home and
enlisted for the war nearly all of them were well disciplined and many
of them experienced in actual campaigns the armies of king george
fought bravely as the records of bunker hill brandywine and monmouth
demonstrate many a man and subordinate officer and for that matter
some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against
their own kin but they obeyed orders

the americans on the other hand while they fought with grim
determination as men fighting for their homes were lacking in
discipline and in the experience of regular troops when the war broke
in upon them there were no common preparations for it there was no
continental army there were only local bands of militiamen many of
them experienced in fighting but few of them regulars in the military
sense moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time
unaccustomed to severe discipline and impatient at the restraints
imposed on them by long and arduous campaigns they were continually
leaving the service just at the most critical moments the militia
lamented washington come in you cannot tell how go you cannot tell
where consume your provisions exhaust your stores and leave you at
last at a critical moment

again and again washington begged congress to provide for an army of
regulars enlisted for the war thoroughly trained and paid according to
some definite plan at last he was able to overcome in part at least
the chronic fear of civilians in congress and to wring from that
reluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a
bonus to all privates who served until the end of the war even this
scheme which washington regarded as far short of justice to the
soldiers did not produce quick results it was near the close of the
conflict before he had an army of welldisciplined veterans capable of
meeting british regulars on equal terms

though there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and
effective work it is due to historical accuracy to deny the
timehonored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous
forces of regulars in a seven years war for independence they did
nothing of the sort for the victories of bennington trenton saratoga
and yorktown there were the defeats of bunker hill long island white
plains germantown and camden not once did an army of militiamen
overcome an equal number of british regulars in an open trial by battle
to bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier wrote
washington requires time to expect the same service from raw and
undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never
did and perhaps never will happen

how the war was wonthen how did the american army win the war for
one thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the british
generals who in  and  dallied in boston and new york with
large bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing
paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the american
army nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved
us solemnly averred washington in  still it is fair to say that
this apparent supineness was not all due to the british generals the
ministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were
loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a
war vigorously prosecuted victory by masterly inactivity was obviously
better than conquest and the slighter the wounds the quicker the
healing later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of france were
thrown into the scale the americans themselves had learned many things
about the practical conduct of campaigns all along the british were
embarrassed by the problem of supplies their troops could not forage
with the skill of militiamen as they were in unfamiliar territory the
long oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the
warships of france joined the american privateers in preying on supply
boats

the british were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and
outdone on two important occasions by superior forcesat saratoga and
yorktown stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army which
could be raised only by a supreme effort would be necessary to subdue
the colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all
they learned also that america would then be alienated fretful and the
scene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation that was a
price which staggered even lord north and george iii moreover there
were forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon

women and the warat no time were the women of america indifferent
to the struggle for independence when it was confined to the realm of
opinion they did their part in creating public sentiment mrs elizabeth
timothee for example founded in charleston in  a newspaper to
espouse the cause of the province far to the north the sister of james
otis mrs mercy warren early begged her countrymen to rest their case
upon their natural rights and in influential circles she urged the
leaders to stand fast by their principles while john adams was tossing
about with uncertainty at the continental congress his wife was writing
letters to him declaring her faith in independency

when the war came down upon the country women helped in every field in
sustaining public sentiment they were active mrs warren with a
tireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire
almost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered
service in the second line of defense mrs washington managed the
plantation while the general was at the front and went north to face the
rigors of the awful winter at valley forgean inspiration to her
husband and his men the daughter of benjamin franklin mrs sarah
bache while her father was pleading the american cause in france set
the women of pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies even
near the firing line women were to be found aiding the wounded hauling
powder to the front and carrying dispatches at the peril of their
lives

in the economic sphere the work of women was invaluable they harvested
crops without enjoying the picturesque title of farmerettes and they
canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war of their
labor in spinning and weaving it is recorded immediately on being cut
off from the use of english manufactures the women engaged within their
own families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use
they thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their
labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for
themselves in this way the female part of families by their industry
and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle
evincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their
service

for their war work women were commended by high authorities on more
than one occasion they were given medals and public testimonials even
as in our own day washington thanked them for their labors and paid
tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had
given to the cause of independence


the finances of the revolution

when the revolution opened there were thirteen little treasuries in
america but no common treasury and from first to last the congress was
in the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign having no authority
to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the
provincials for taxation it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to
finance the war do you think boldly inquired one of the delegates
that i will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send
to the printer and get a wagon load of money one quire of which will
pay for the whole

paper money and loansacting on this curious but appealing political
economy congress issued in june  two million dollars in bills of
credit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective
populations other issues followed in quick succession in all about
 of continental paper was printed to which the several
states added nearly  of their own notes then came
interestbearing bonds in ever increasing quantities several millions
were also borrowed from france and small sums from holland and spain in
desperation a national lottery was held producing meager results the
property of tories was confiscated and sold bringing in about
 begging letters were sent to the states asking them to
raise revenues for the continental treasury but the states burdened
with their own affairs gave little heed

inflation and depreciationas paper money flowed from the press it
rapidly declined in purchasing power until in  a dollar was worth
only two or three cents in gold or silver attempts were made by
congress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face
value but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill
speculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the
republic fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public
securities while the patriot army half clothed was freezing at valley
forge speculation peculation engrossing forestalling exclaimed
washington afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public
virtue nothing i am convinced but the depreciation of our currency
 aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of
the enemy

the patriot financiersto the efforts of congress in financing the
war were added the labors of private citizens hayn solomon a merchant
of philadelphia supplied members of congress including madison
jefferson and monroe and army officers like lee and steuben with
money for their daily needs all together he contributed the huge sum of
half a million dollars to the american cause and died broken in purse
if not in spirit a british prisoner of war another philadelphia
merchant robert morris won for himself the name of the patriot
financier because he labored night and day to find the money to meet
the bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government when his own
funds were exhausted he borrowed from his friends experienced in the
handling of merchandise he created agencies at important points to
distribute supplies to the troops thus displaying administrative as
well as financial talents

illustration robert morris

women organized drives for money contributed their plate and their
jewels and collected from door to door farmers took worthless paper in
return for their produce and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without
yielding them a penny thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens
the issuance of paper money lotteries the floating of loans
borrowings in europe and the impressment of supplies the congress
staggered through the revolution like a pauper who knows not how his
next meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a
kindly fate


the diplomacy of the revolution

when the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and
their commanding officers the civilians who managed finances and
supplies the writers who sustained the american spirit and the women
who did well their part there yet remains the duty of recognizing the
achievements of diplomacy the importance of this field of activity was
keenly appreciated by the leaders in the continental congress they were
fairly well versed in european history they knew of the balance of
power and the sympathies interests and prejudices of nations and their
rulers all this information they turned to good account in opening
relations with continental countries and seeking money supplies and
even military assistance for the transaction of this delicate business
they created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as
 and prepared to send agents abroad

american agents sent abroadhaving heard that france was inclining a
friendly ear to the american cause the congress in march  sent a
commissioner to paris silas deane of connecticut often styled the
first american diplomat later in the year a form of treaty to be
presented to foreign powers was drawn up and franklin arthur lee and
deane were selected as american representatives at the court of his
most christian majesty the king of france john jay of new york was
chosen minister to spain in  john adams was sent to holland the
same year and other agents were dispatched to florence vienna and
berlin the representative selected for st petersburg spent two
fruitless years there ignored by the court living in obscurity and
experiencing nothing but humiliation and failure frederick the great
king of prussia expressed a desire to find in america a market for
silesian linens and woolens but fearing englands command of the sea
he refused to give direct aid to the revolutionary cause

early french interestthe great diplomatic triumph of the revolution
was won at paris and benjamin franklin was the hero of the occasion
although many circumstances prepared the way for his success louis
xvis foreign minister count de vergennes before the arrival of any
american representative had brought to the attention of the king the
opportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between england and her
colonies he showed him how france could redress her grievances and
reduce the power and greatness of englandthe empire that in  had
forced upon her a humiliating peace at the price of our possessions
of our commerce and our credit in the indies at the price of canada
louisiana isle royale acadia and senegal equally successful in
gaining the kings interest was a curious french adventurer
beaumarchais a man of wealth a lover of music and the author of two
popular plays figaro and the barber of seville these two men had
already urged upon the king secret aid for america before deane appeared
on the scene shortly after his arrival they made confidential
arrangements to furnish money clothing powder and other supplies to
the struggling colonies although official requests for them were
officially refused by the french government

franklin at pariswhen franklin reached paris he was received only
in private by the kings minister vergennes the french people
however made manifest their affection for the plain republican in
his full dress suit of spotted manchester velvet he was known among
men of letters as an author a scientist and a philosopher of
extraordinary ability his poor richard had thrice been translated
into french and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the
kingdom people of all ranksministers ladies at court philosophers
peasants and stable boysknew of franklin and wished him success in
his mission the queen marie antoinette fated to lose her head in a
revolution soon to follow played with fire by encouraging our dear
republican

for the king of france however this was more serious business england
resented the presence of this traitor in paris and louis had to be
cautious about plunging into another war that might also end
disastrously moreover the early period of franklins sojourn in paris
was a dark hour for the american revolution washingtons brilliant
exploit at trenton on christmas night  and the battle with
cornwallis at princeton had been followed by the disaster at brandywine
the loss of philadelphia the defeat at germantown and the retirement
to valley forge for the winter of  new york city and
philadelphiatwo strategic portswere in british hands the hudson
and delaware rivers were blocked and general burgoyne with his british
troops was on his way down through the heart of northern new york
cutting new england off from the rest of the colonies no wonder the
king was cautious then the unexpected happened burgoyne hemmed in
from all sides by the american forces his flanks harried his foraging
parties beaten back his supplies cut off surrendered on october 
 to general gates who had superseded general schuyler in time to
receive the honor

treaties of alliance and commerce news of this victory
placed by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world
reached franklin one night early in december while he and some friends
sat gloomily at dinner beaumarchais who was with him grasped at once
the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at versailles with
such haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm the king and
his ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the
revolution treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed
in february  the independence of the united states was recognized
by france and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence
combined military action was agreed upon and louis then formally
declared war on england men who had a few short years before fought
one another in the wilderness of pennsylvania or on the plains of
abraham were now ranged side by side in a war on the empire that pitt
had erected and that george iii was pulling down

spain and holland involvedwithin a few months spain remembering
the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the armada and
hoping to drive the british out of gibraltar once more joined the
concert of nations against england holland a member of a league of
armed neutrals formed in protest against british searches on the high
seas sent her fleet to unite with the forces of spain france and
america to prey upon british commerce to all this trouble for england
was added the danger of a possible revolt in ireland where the spirit
of independence was flaming up

the british offer terms to americaseeing the colonists about to be
joined by france in a common war on the english empire lord north
proposed in february  a renewal of negotiations by solemn
enactment parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right
of imposing taxes within the colonies at the same time it authorized
the opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to america
a truce was to be established pardons granted objectionable laws
suspended and the old imperial constitution as it stood before the
opening of hostilities restored to full vigor it was too late events
had taken the affairs of america out of the hands of british
commissioners and diplomats

effects of french aidthe french alliance brought ships of war
large sums of gold and silver loads of supplies and a considerable
body of trained soldiers to the aid of the americans timely as was this
help it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war the british
evacuated philadelphia in the summer following the alliance and
washingtons troops were encouraged to come out of valley forge they
inflicted a heavy blow on the british at monmouth but the treasonable
conduct of general charles lee prevented a triumph the recovery of
philadelphia was offset by the treason of benedict arnold the loss of
savannah and charleston  and the defeat of gates at camden

the full effect of the french alliance was not felt until  when
cornwallis went into virginia and settled at yorktown accompanied by
french troops washington swept rapidly southward and penned the british
to the shore while a powerful french fleet shut off their escape by sea
it was this movement which certainly could not have been executed
without french aid that put an end to all chance of restoring british
dominion in america it was the surrender of cornwallis at yorktown that
caused lord north to pace the floor and cry out it is all over it is
all over what might have been done without the french alliance lies
hidden from mankind what was accomplished with the help of french
soldiers sailors officers money and supplies is known to all the
earth all the world agree exultantly wrote franklin from paris to
general washington that no expedition was ever better planned or
better executed it brightens the glory that must accompany your name to
the latest posterity diplomacy as well as martial valor had its
reward


peace at last

british opposition to the warin measuring the forces that led to
the final discomfiture of king george and lord north it is necessary to
remember that from the beginning to the end the british ministry at home
faced a powerful informed and relentless opposition there were
vigorous protests first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated
the unhappy quarrel then against the way in which the war was waged
and finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the
american dominions among the members of parliament who thundered
against the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land
william pitt earl of chatham though he deplored the idea of american
independence denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in
american resistance edmund burke leveled his heavy batteries against
every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which while
giving independence to america would work for reconciliation rather
than estrangement charles james fox gave the colonies his generous
sympathy and warmly championed their rights outside of the circle of
statesmen there were stout friends of the american cause like david
hume the philosopher and historian and catherine macaulay an author
of wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage washington in
seeing it through

against this powerful opposition the government enlisted a whole army
of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the americans and
their friends dr samuel johnson whom it employed in this business
was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets
before printing them far more weighty was edward gibbon who was in
time to win fame as the historian of the decline and fall of the roman
empire he had at first opposed the government but on being given a
lucrative post he used his sharp pen in its support causing his
friends to ridicule him in these lines

    king george in a fright
     lest gibbon should write
       the story of englands disgrace
     thought no way so sure
     his pen to secure
       as to give the historian a place

lord north yieldsas time wore on events bore heavily on the side
of the opponents of the governments measures they had predicted that
conquest was impossible and they had urged the advantages of a peace
which would in some measure restore the affections of the americans
every days news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their
arguments moreover the war which sprang out of an effort to relieve
english burdens made those burdens heavier than ever military expenses
were daily increasing trade with the colonies the greatest single
outlet for british goods and capital was paralyzed the heavy debts due
british merchants in america were not only unpaid but postponed into an
indefinite future ireland was on the verge of revolution the french
had a dangerous fleet on the high seas in vain did the king assert in
december  that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a
peace that meant american independence parliament knew better and on
february   in the house of commons was carried an address to the
throne against continuing the war burke fox the younger pitt barre
and other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative lord north
gave notice then that his ministry was at an end the king moaned
necessity made me yield

in april  franklin received word from the english government that
it was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement this
was embarrassing in the treaty of alliance with france the united
states had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by
both nations in open conference finding france however opposed to
some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries the american
commissioners conferred with the british agents at paris without
consulting the french minister they actually signed a preliminary peace
draft before they informed him of their operations when vergennes
reproached him franklin replied that they had been guilty of
neglecting bienseance good manners but hoped that the great work
would not be ruined by a single indiscretion

the terms of peace the general settlement at paris in 
was a triumph for america england recognized the independence of the
united states naming each state specifically and agreed to boundaries
extending from the atlantic to the mississippi and from the great lakes
to the floridas england held canada newfoundland and the west indies
intact made gains in india and maintained her supremacy on the seas
spain won florida and minorca but not the coveted gibraltar france
gained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing england humbled
and the colonies independent

the generous terms secured by the american commission at paris called
forth surprise and gratitude in the united states and smoothed the way
for a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country at the
same time they gave genuine anxiety to european diplomats this federal
republic is born a pigmy wrote the spanish ambassador to his royal
master a day will come when it will be a giant even a colossus
formidable to these countries liberty of conscience and the facility
for establishing a new population on immense lands as well as the
advantages of the new government will draw thither farmers and artisans
from all the nations in a few years we shall watch with grief the
tyrannical existence of the same colossus

summary of the revolutionary period

the independence of the american colonies was foreseen by many european
statesmen as they watched the growth of their population wealth and
power but no one could fix the hour of the great event until  the
american colonists lived fairly happily under british dominion there
were collisions from time to time of course royal governors clashed
with stiffnecked colonial legislatures there were protests against the
exercise of the kings veto power in specific cases nevertheless on
the whole the relations between america and the mother country were
more amicable in  than at any period under the stuart regime which
closed in 

the crash when it came was not deliberately willed by any one it was
the product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 
three years before there had come to the throne george iii a young
proud inexperienced and stubborn king for nearly fifty years his
predecessors germans as they were in language and interest had allowed
things to drift in england and america george iii decided that he would
be king in fact as well as in name about the same time england brought
to a close the long and costly french and indian war and was staggering
under a heavy burden of debt and taxes the war had been fought partly
in defense of the american colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable
to english statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of
the cost of their own defense at this juncture there came into
prominence in royal councils two men bent on taxing america and
controlling her trade grenville and townshend the king was willing
the english taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief and
statesmen were found to undertake the experiment england therefore set
out upon a new course she imposed taxes upon the colonists regulated
their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law this
action evoked protests from the colonists they held a stamp act
congress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of
grievances some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets
sacked the houses of the kings officers and tore up the stamped paper

frightened by uprising the english government drew back and repealed
the stamp act then it veered again and renewed its policy of
interference interference again called forth american protests
protests aroused sharper retaliation more british regulars were sent
over to keep order more irritating laws were passed by parliament
rioting again appeared tea was dumped in the harbor of boston and
seized in the harbor of charleston the british answer was more force
the response of the colonists was a continental congress for defense an
unexpected and unintended clash of arms at lexington and concord in the
spring of  brought forth from the king of england a proclamation
the americans are rebels

the die was cast the american revolution had begun washington was made
commanderinchief armies were raised money was borrowed a huge
volume of paper currency was issued and foreign aid was summoned
franklin plied his diplomatic arts at paris until in  he induced
france to throw her sword into the balance three years later
cornwallis surrendered at yorktown in  by the formal treaty of
peace george iii acknowledged the independence of the united states
the new nation endowed with an imperial domain stretching from the
atlantic ocean to the mississippi river began its career among the
sovereign powers of the earth

in the sphere of civil government the results of the revolution were
equally remarkable royal officers and royal authorities were driven
from the former dominions all power was declared to be in the people
all the colonies became states each with its own constitution or plan
of government the thirteen states were united in common bonds under the
articles of confederation a republic on a large scale was instituted
thus there was begun an adventure in popular government such as the
world had never seen could it succeed or was it destined to break down
and be supplanted by a monarchy the fate of whole continents hung upon
the answer

the formation of the constitution


the promise and the difficulties of america

the rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states each governed
by officials popularly elected under constitutions drafted by the plain
people was the most significant feature of the eighteenth century the
majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this
possible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good those
americans however who peered beneath the surface of things saw that
the declaration of independence even if splendidly phrased and paper
constitutions drawn by finest enthusiasm uninstructed by experience
could not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free all
around them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the
immediate future

the weakness of the articles of confederationthe government under
the articles of confederation had neither the strength nor the resources
necessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war
the sole organ of government was a congress composed of from two to
seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and
paid by the state in determining all questions each state had one
votedelaware thus enjoying the same weight as virginia there was no
president to enforce the laws congress was given power to select a
committee of thirteenone from each stateto act as an executive body
when it was not in session but this device on being tried out proved
a failure there was no system of national courts to which citizens and
states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which
they could compel obedience to law the two great powers of government
military and financial were withheld congress it is true could
authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment
of contributions to meet its bills it could also order the
establishment of an army but it could only request the states to supply
their respective quotas of soldiers it could not lay taxes nor bring
any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country it
could act only through the medium of the state governments

financial and commercial disordersin the field of public finance
the disorders were pronounced the huge debt incurred during the war was
still outstanding congress was unable to pay either the interest or the
principal public creditors were in despair as the market value of
their bonds sank to twentyfive or even ten cents on the dollar the
current bills of congress were unpaid as some one complained there was
not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record
the transactions of the shadow legislature the currency was in utter
chaos millions of dollars in notes issued by congress had become mere
trash worth a cent or two on the dollar there was no other expression
of contempt so forceful as the popular saying not worth a
continental to make matters worse several of the states were pouring
new streams of paper money from the press almost the only good money in
circulation consisted of english french and spanish coins and the
public was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy
clipping and filing away the metal foreign commerce was unsettled the
entire british system of trade discrimination was turned against the
americans and congress having no power to regulate foreign commerce
was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce
domestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states which
erected tariff barriers against their neighbors the condition of the
currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult and
as if to increase the confusion backward states enacted laws hindering
the prompt collection of debts within their bordersan evil which
nothing but a national system of courts could cure

congress in disreputewith treaties set at naught by the states the
laws unenforced the treasury empty and the public credit gone the
congress of the united states fell into utter disrepute it called upon
the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury only to be
treated with contempt even its own members looked upon it as a solemn
futility some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it and
many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions
again and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction
of business

troubles of the state governmentsthe state governments free to
pursue their own course with no interference from without had almost as
many difficulties as the congress they too were loaded with
revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive
population oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the
fall in prices which followed the return of peace the farmers of
several states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their
legislatures to issue large sums of paper money the currency fell in
value but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square
old accounts

in every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently
laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the
third year lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were
canceled by its successor uncertainty and distrust were the natural
consequences men of substance longed for some power that would forbid
states to issue bills of credit to make paper money legal tender in
payment of debts or to impair the obligation of contracts men heavily
in debt on the other hand urged even more drastic action against
creditors

so great did the discontent of the farmers in new hampshire become in
 that a mob surrounded the legislature demanding a repeal of the
taxes and the issuance of paper money it was with difficulty that an
armed rebellion was avoided in massachusetts the malcontents under the
leadership of daniel shays a captain in the revolutionary army
organized that same year open resistance to the government of the state
shays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in
foreclosing mortgages upon the debtburdened farmers against the
lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings against the
senate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the
towns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid against heavy taxes and
against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money they seized
the towns of worcester and springfield and broke up the courts of
justice all through the western part of the state the revolt spread
sending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young
republic only by the most vigorous action was governor bowdoin able to
quell the uprising and when that task was accomplished the state
government did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had
so many sympathizers moreover bowdoin and several members of the
legislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents
were defeated at the ensuing election the need of national assistance
for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere
emphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts

alarm over dangers to the republicleading american citizens
watching the drift of affairs were slowly driven to the conclusion that
the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was
careening into anarchy the facts of our peace and independence wrote
a friend of washington do not at present wear so promising an
appearance as i had fondly painted in my mind the prejudices
jealousies and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my
confidence in our political establishments and almost occasion me to
think that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for
which we have contended

washington himself was profoundly discouraged on hearing of shayss
rebellion he exclaimed what gracious god is man that there should
be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct it is but the
other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions
under which we now liveconstitutions of our own choice and makingand
now we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them the same year he
burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government i am
told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government
without horror from thinking proceeds speaking hence to acting is
often but a single step but how irresistible and tremendous what a
triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions what a triumph for
the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing
ourselves

congress attempts some reformsthe congress was not indifferent to
the events that disturbed washington on the contrary it put forth many
efforts to check tendencies so dangerous to finance commerce
industries and the confederation itself in  even before the
treaty of peace was signed the congress having found out how futile
were its taxing powers carried a resolution of amendment to the
articles of confederation authorizing the levy of a moderate duty on
imports yet this mild measure was rejected by the states two years
later the congress prepared another amendment sanctioning the levy of
duties on imports to be collected this time by state officers and
applied to the payment of the public debt this more limited proposal
designed to save public credit likewise failed in  the congress
made a third appeal to the states for help declaring that they had been
so irregular and so negligent in paying their quotas that further
reliance upon that mode of raising revenues was dishonorable and
dangerous


the calling of a constitutional convention

hamilton and washington urge reformthe attempts at reform by the
congress were accompanied by demand for both within and without that
body a convention to frame a new plan of government in  the
youthful alexander hamilton realizing the weakness of the articles so
widely discussed proposed a general convention for the purpose of
drafting a new constitution on entirely different principles with
tireless energy he strove to bring his countrymen to his view
washington agreeing with him on every point declared in a circular
letter to the governors that the duration of the union would be short
unless there was lodged somewhere a supreme power to regulate and
govern the general concerns of the confederated republic the governor
of massachusetts disturbed by the growth of discontent all about him
suggested to the state legislature in  the advisability of a
national convention to enlarge the powers of the congress the
legislature approved the plan but did not press it to a conclusion

illustration alexander hamilton

the annapolis conventionaction finally came from the south the
virginia legislature taking things into its own hands called a
conference of delegates at annapolis to consider matters of taxation and
commerce when the convention assembled in  it was found that only
five states had taken the trouble to send representatives the leaders
were deeply discouraged but the resourceful hamilton a delegate from
new york turned the affair to good account he secured the adoption of
a resolution calling upon the congress itself to summon another
convention to meet at philadelphia

a national convention called the congress as tardy as ever
at last decided in february  to issue the call fearing drastic
changes however it restricted the convention to the sole and express
purpose of revising the articles of confederation jealous of its own
powers it added that any alterations proposed should be referred to the
congress and the states for their approval

every state in the union except rhode island responded to this call
indeed some of the states having the annapolis resolution before them
had already anticipated the congress by selecting delegates before the
formal summons came thus by the persistence of governors
legislatures and private citizens there was brought about the
longdesired national convention in may  it assembled in
philadelphia

the eminent men of the conventionon the roll of that memorable
convention were fiftyfive men at least half of whom were acknowledged
to be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in america every field
of statecraft was represented by them war and practical management in
washington who was chosen president of the convention diplomacy in
franklin now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad
finance in alexander hamilton and robert morris law in james wilson of
pennsylvania the philosophy of government in james madison called the
father of the constitution they were not theorists but practical men
rich in political experience and endowed with deep insight into the
springs of human action three of them had served in the stamp act
congress dickinson of delaware william samuel johnson of connecticut
and john rutledge of south carolina eight had been signers of the
declaration of independence read of delaware sherman of connecticut
wythe of virginia gerry of massachusetts franklin robert morris
george clymer and james wilson of pennsylvania all but twelve had at
some time served in the continental congress and eighteen were members
of that body in the spring of  washington hamilton mifflin and
charles pinckney had been officers in the revolutionary army seven of
the delegates had gained political experience as governors of states
the convention as a whole according to the historian hildreth
represented in a marked manner the talent intelligence and
especially the conservative sentiment of the country


the framing of the constitution

problems involvedthe great problems before the convention were nine
in number  shall the articles of confederation be revised or a new
system of government constructed  shall the government be founded on
states equal in power as under the articles or on the broader and deeper
foundation of population  what direct share shall the people have in
the election of national officers  what shall be the qualifications
for the suffrage  how shall the conflicting interests of the
commercial and the planting states be balanced so as to safeguard the
essential rights of each  what shall be the form of the new
government  what powers shall be conferred on it  how shall the
state legislatures be restrained from their attacks on property rights
such as the issuance of paper money  shall the approval of all the
states be necessary as under the articles for the adoption and
amendment of the constitution

revision of the articles or a new governmentthe moment the first
problem was raised representatives of the small states led by william
paterson of new jersey were on their feet they feared that if the
articles were overthrown the equality and rights of the states would be
put in jeopardy their protest was therefore vigorous they cited the
call issued by the congress in summoning the convention which
specifically stated that they were assembled for the sole and express
purpose of revising the articles of confederation they cited also
their instructions from their state legislatures which authorized them
to revise and amend the existing scheme of government not to make a
revolution in it to depart from the authorization laid down by the
congress and the legislatures would be to exceed their powers they
argued and to betray the trust reposed in them by their countrymen

to their contentions randolph of virginia replied when the salvation
of the republic is at stake it would be treason to our trust not to
propose what we find necessary hamilton reminding the delegates that
their work was still subject to the approval of the states frankly said
that on the point of their powers he had no scruples with the issue
clear the convention cast aside the articles as if they did not exist
and proceeded to the work of drawing up a new constitution laying its
foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form
as to the delegates seemed most likely to affect their safety and
happiness

a government founded on states or on peoplethe
compromisedefeated in their attempt to limit the convention to a
mere revision of the articles the spokesmen of the smaller states
redoubled their efforts to preserve the equality of the states the
signal for a radical departure from the articles on this point was given
early in the sessions when randolph presented the virginia plan he
proposed that the new national legislature consist of two houses the
members of which were to be apportioned among the states according to
their wealth or free white population as the convention might decide
this plan was vehemently challenged paterson of new jersey flatly
avowed that neither he nor his state would ever bow to such tyranny as
an alternative he presented the new jersey plan calling for a
national legislature of one house representing states as such not
wealth or peoplea legislature in which all states large or small
would have equal voice wilson of pennsylvania on behalf of the more
populous states took up the gauntlet which paterson had thrown down it
was absurd he urged for  men in one state to have the same
weight in national counsels as  men in another state the
gentleman from new jersey he said is candid he declares his opinion
boldly i will be equally candid i will never confederate on his
principles so the bitter controversy ran on through many exciting
sessions

greek had met greek the convention was hopelessly deadlocked and on the
verge of dissolution scarce held together by the strength of a hair
as one of the delegates remarked a crash was averted only by a
compromise instead of a congress of one house as provided by the
articles the convention agreed upon a legislature of two houses in the
senate the aspirations of the small states were to be satisfied for
each state was given two members in that body in the formation of the
house of representatives the larger states were placated for it was
agreed that the members of that chamber were to be apportioned among the
states on the basis of population counting threefifths of the slaves

the question of popular electionthe method of selecting federal
officers and members of congress also produced an acrimonious debate
which revealed how deepseated was the distrust of the capacity of the
people to govern themselves few there were who believed that no branch
of the government should be elected directly by the voters still fewer
were there however who desired to see all branches so chosen one or
two even expressed a desire for a monarchy the dangers of democracy
were stressed by gerry of massachusetts all the evils we experience
flow from an excess of democracy the people do not want virtue but are
the dupes of pretended patriots i have been too republican
heretofore but have been taught by experience the danger of a leveling
spirit to the democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures
randolph sought to oppose a firm senate to check the excesses of
popular government charles pinckney of south carolina declared that no
one should be elected president who was not worth  and that high
property qualifications should be placed on members of congress and
judges other members of the convention were stoutly opposed to such
hightoned notions of government franklin and wilson both from
pennsylvania vigorously championed popular election while men like
madison insisted that at least one part of the government should rest on
the broad foundation of the people

out of this clash of opinion also came compromise one branch the house
of representatives it was agreed was to be elected directly by the
voters while the senators were to be elected indirectly by the state
legislatures the president was to be chosen by electors selected as the
legislatures of the states might determine and the judges of the
federal courts supreme and inferior by the president and the senate

the question of the suffragethe battle over the suffrage was sharp
but brief gouverneur morris proposed that only land owners should be
permitted to vote madison replied that the state legislatures which
had made so much trouble with radical laws were elected by freeholders
after the debate the delegates unable to agree on any property
limitations on the suffrage decided that the house of representatives
should be elected by voters having the qualifications requisite for
electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature thus
they accepted the suffrage provisions of the states

the balance between the planting and the commercial statesafter the
debates had gone on for a few weeks madison came to the conclusion that
the real division in the convention was not between the large and the
small states but between the planting section founded on slave labor and
the commercial north thus he anticipated by nearly threequarters of a
century the irrepressible conflict the planting states had neither
the free white population nor the wealth of the north there were
counting delaware six of them as against seven commercial states
dependent for their prosperity mainly upon the sale of tobacco rice
and other staples abroad they feared that congress might impose
restraints upon their enterprise being weaker in numbers they were
afraid that the majority might lay an unfair burden of taxes upon them

representation and taxationthe southern members of the convention
were therefore very anxious to secure for their section the largest
possible representation in congress and at the same time to restrain
the taxing power of that body two devices were thought adapted to these
ends one was to count the slaves as people when apportioning
representatives among the states according to their respective
populations the other was to provide that direct taxes should be
apportioned among the states in proportion not to their wealth but to
the number of their free white inhabitants for obvious reasons the
northern delegates objected to these proposals once more a compromise
proved to be the solution it was agreed that not all the slaves but
threefifths of them should be counted for both purposesrepresentation
and direct taxation

commerce and the slave tradesouthern interests were also involved
in the project to confer upon congress the power to regulate interstate
and foreign commerce to the manufacturing and trading states this was
essential it would prevent interstate tariffs and trade jealousies it
would enable congress to protect american manufactures and to break
down by appropriate retaliations foreign discriminations against
american commerce to the south the proposal was menacing because
tariffs might interfere with the free exchange of the produce of
plantations in european markets and navigation acts might confine the
carrying trade to american that is northern ships the importation of
slaves moreover it was feared might be heavily taxed or immediately
prohibited altogether

the result of this and related controversies was a debate on the merits
of slavery gouverneur morris delivered his mind and heart on that
subject denouncing slavery as a nefarious institution and the curse of
heaven on the states in which it prevailed mason of virginia a
slaveholder himself was hardly less outspoken saying slavery
discourages arts and manufactures the poor despise labor when performed
by slaves they prevent the migration of whites who really strengthen
and enrich a country

the system however had its defenders representatives from south
carolina argued that their entire economic life rested on slave labor
and that the high death rate in the rice swamps made continuous
importation necessary ellsworth of connecticut took the ground that
the convention should not meddle with slavery the morality or wisdom
of slavery he said are considerations belonging to the states what
enriches a part enriches the whole to the future he turned an
untroubled face as population increases poor laborers will be so
plenty as to render slaves useless slavery in time will not be a speck
in our country virginia and north carolina already overstocked with
slaves favored prohibiting the traffic in them but south carolina was
adamant she must have fresh supplies of slaves or she would not
federate

so it was agreed that while congress might regulate foreign trade by
majority vote the importation of slaves should not be forbidden before
the lapse of twenty years and that any import tax should not exceed 
a head at the same time in connection with the regulation of foreign
trade it was stipulated that a twothirds vote in the senate should be
necessary in the ratification of treaties a further concession to the
south was made in the provision for the return of runaway slavesa
provision also useful in the north where indentured servants were about
as troublesome as slaves in escaping from their masters

the form of the governmentas to the details of the frame of
government and the grand principles involved the opinion of the
convention ebbed and flowed decisions being taken in the heat of
debate only to be revoked and taken again

the executivethere was general agreement that there should be an
executive branch for reliance upon congress to enforce its own laws and
treaties had been a broken reed on the character and functions of the
executive however there were many views the new jersey plan called
for a council selected by the congress the virginia plan provided that
the executive branch should be chosen by the congress but did not state
whether it should be composed of one or several persons on this matter
the convention voted first one way and then another finally it agreed
on a single executive chosen indirectly by electors selected as the
state legislatures might decide serving for four years subject to
impeachment and endowed with regal powers in the command of the army
and the navy and in the enforcement of the laws

the legislative branchcongressafter the convention had made the
great compromise between the large and small commonwealths by giving
representation to states in the senate and to population in the house
the question of methods of election had to be decided as to the house
of representatives it was readily agreed that the members should be
elected by direct popular vote there was also easy agreement on the
proposition that a strong senate was needed to check the turbulence of
the lower house four devices were finally selected to accomplish this
purpose in the first place the senators were not to be chosen directly
by the voters but by the legislatures of the states thus removing their
election one degree from the populace in the second place their term
was fixed at six years instead of two as in the case of the house in
the third place provision was made for continuity by having only
onethird of the members go out at a time while twothirds remained in
service finally it was provided that senators must be at least thirty
years old while representatives need be only twentyfive

the judiciarythe need for federal courts to carry out the law was
hardly open to debate the feebleness of the articles of confederation
was in a large measure attributed to the want of a judiciary to hold
states and individuals in obedience to the laws and treaties of the
union nevertheless on this point the advocates of states rights were
extremely sensitive they looked with distrust upon judges appointed at
the national capital and emancipated from local interests and
traditions they remembered with what insistence they had claimed
against britain the right of local trial by jury and with what
consternation they had viewed the proposal to make colonial judges
independent of the assemblies in the matter of their salaries
reluctantly they yielded to the demand for federal courts consenting at
first only to a supreme court to review cases heard in lower state
courts and finally to such additional inferior courts as congress might
deem necessary

the system of checks and balancesit is thus apparent that the
framers of the constitution in shaping the form of government arranged
for a distribution of power among three branches executive
legislative and judicial strictly speaking we might say four branches
for the legislature or congress was composed of two houses elected in
different ways and one of them the senate was made a check on the
president through its power of ratifying treaties and appointments the
accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judicial in the
same hands wrote madison whether of one a few or many and whether
hereditary selfappointed or elective may justly be pronounced the
very definition of tyranny the devices which the convention adopted to
prevent such a centralization of authority were exceedingly ingenious
and well calculated to accomplish the purposes of the authors

the legislature consisted of two houses the members of which were to be
apportioned on a different basis elected in different ways and to
serve for different terms a veto on all its acts was vested in a
president elected in a manner not employed in the choice of either
branch of the legislature serving for four years and subject to
removal only by the difficult process of impeachment after a law had
run the gantlet of both houses and the executive it was subject to
interpretation and annulment by the judiciary appointed by the
president with the consent of the senate and serving for life thus it
was made almost impossible for any political party to get possession of
all branches of the government at a single popular election as hamilton
remarked the friends of good government considered every institution
calculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in
the same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more
likely to do good than harm

the powers of the federal governmenton the question of the powers
to be conferred upon the new government there was less occasion for a
serious dispute even the delegates from the small states agreed with
those from massachusetts pennsylvania and virginia that new powers
should be added to those intrusted to congress by the articles of
confederation the new jersey plan as well as the virginia plan
recognized this fact some of the delegates like hamilton and madison
even proposed to give congress a general legislative authority covering
all national matters but others frightened by the specter of
nationalism insisted on specifying each power to be conferred and
finally carried the day

taxation and commercethere were none bold enough to dissent from
the proposition that revenue must be provided to pay current expenses
and discharge the public debt when once the dispute over the
apportionment of direct taxes among the slave states was settled it was
an easy matter to decide that congress should have power to lay and
collect taxes duties imposts and excises in this way the national
government was freed from dependence upon stubborn and tardy
legislatures and enabled to collect funds directly from citizens there
were likewise none bold enough to contend that the anarchy of state
tariffs and trade discriminations should be longer endured when the
fears of the planting states were allayed and the bargain over the
importation of slaves was reached the convention vested in congress the
power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce

national defensethe necessity for national defense was realized
though the fear of huge military establishments was equally present the
old practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures
was completely discredited as in the case of taxes a direct authority
over citizens was demanded congress was therefore given full power to
raise and support armies and a navy it could employ the state militia
when desirable but it could at the same time maintain a regular army
and call directly upon all ablebodied males if the nature of a crisis
was thought to require it

the necessary and proper clauseto the specified power vested in
congress by the constitution the advocates of a strong national
government added a general clause authorizing it to make all laws
necessary and proper for carrying into effect any and all of the
enumerated powers this clause interpreted by that master mind chief
justice marshall was later construed to confer powers as wide as the
requirements of a vast country spanning a continent and taking its place
among the mighty nations of the earth

restraints on the statesframing a government and endowing it with
large powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention its
very existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state
legislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed continental congress
in every state explains marshall in his life of washington there was
a party of men who had marked out for themselves a more indulgent
course viewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor their
efforts were unceasingly directed to his relief to exact a faithful
compliance with contracts was in their opinion a harsh measure which
the people could not bear they were uniformly in favor of relaxing the
administration of justice of affording facilities for the payment of
debts or of suspending their collection and remitting taxes

the legislatures under the dominance of these men had enacted paper
money laws enabling debtors to discharge their obligations more easily
the convention put an end to such practices by providing that no state
should emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal
tender in the payment of debts the state legislatures had enacted laws
allowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or
personal property they had repealed the charter of an endowed college
and taken the management from the hands of the lawful trustees and they
had otherwise interfered with the enforcement of private agreements the
convention taking notice of such matters inserted a clause forbidding
states to impair the obligation of contracts the more venturous of
the radicals had in massachusetts raised the standard of revolt against
the authorities of the state the convention answered by a brief
sentence to the effect that the president of the united states to be
equipped with a regular army would send troops to suppress domestic
insurrections whenever called upon by the legislature or if it was not
in session by the governor of the state to make sure that the
restrictions on the states would not be dead letters the federal
constitution laws and treaties were made the supreme law of the land
to be enforced whenever necessary by a national judiciary and executive
against violations on the part of any state authorities

provisions for ratification and amendmentwhen the frame of
government had been determined the powers to be vested in it had been
enumerated and the restrictions upon the states had been written into
the bond there remained three final questions how shall the
constitution be ratified what number of states shall be necessary to
put it into effect how shall it be amended in the future

on the first point the mandate under which the convention was sitting
seemed positive the articles of confederation were still in effect
they provided that amendments could be made only by unanimous adoption
in congress and the approval of all the states as if to give force to
this provision of law the call for the convention had expressly stated
that all alterations and revisions should be reported to congress for
adoption or rejection congress itself to transmit the document
thereafter to the states for their review

to have observed the strict letter of the law would have defeated the
purposes of the delegates because congress and the state legislatures
were openly hostile to such drastic changes as had been made unanimous
ratification as events proved would have been impossible therefore
the delegates decided that the constitution should be sent to congress
with the recommendation that it in turn transmit the document not to
the state legislatures but to conventions held in the states for the
special object of deciding upon ratification this process was followed
it was their belief that special conventions would be more friendly than
the state legislatures

the convention was equally positive in dealing with the problem of the
number of states necessary to establish the new constitution attempts
to change the articles had failed because amendment required the
approval of every state and there was always at least one recalcitrant
member of the union the opposition to a new constitution was
undoubtedly formidable rhode island had even refused to take part in
framing it and her hostility was deep and open so the convention cast
aside the provision of the articles of confederation which required
unanimous approval for any change in the plan of government it decreed
that the new constitution should go into effect when ratified by nine
states

in providing for future changes in the constitution itself the
convention also thrust aside the old rule of unanimous approval and
decided that an amendment could be made on a twothirds vote in both
houses of congress and ratification by threefourths of the states this
change was of profound significance every state agreed to be bound in
the future by amendments duly adopted even in case it did not approve
them itself america in this way set out upon the high road that led
from a league of states to a nation


the struggle over ratification

on september   the constitution having been finally drafted in
clear and simple language a model to all makers of fundamental law was
adopted the convention after nearly four months of debate in secret
session flung open the doors and presented to the americans the
finished plan for the new government then the great debate passed to
the people

the oppositionstorms of criticism at once descended upon the
constitution fraudulent usurpation exclaimed gerry who had refused
to sign it a monster out of the thick veil of secrecy declaimed a
pennsylvania newspaper an ironhanded despotism will be the result
protested a third we the lowborn sarcastically wrote a fourth
will now admit the six hundred wellborn immediately to establish
this most noble most excellent and truly divine constitution the
president will become a king congress will be as tyrannical as
parliament in the old days the states will be swallowed up the rights
of the people will be trampled upon the poor mans justice will be lost
in the endless delays of the federal courtssuch was the strain of the
protests against ratification

constitution in a series of newspaper articles they discussed and
expounded with eloquence learning and dignity every important clause
and provision of the proposed plan these papers afterwards collected
and published in a volume known as the federalist form the finest
textbook on the constitution that has ever been printed it takes its
place moreover among the wisest and weightiest treatises on government
ever written in any language in any time other men not so gifted were
no less earnest in their support of ratification in private
correspondence editorials pamphlets and letters to the newspapers
they urged their countrymen to forget their partisanship and accept a
constitution which in spite of any defects great or small was the
only guarantee against dissolution and warfare at home and dishonor and
weakness abroad

illustration celebrating the ratification

the action of the state conventionsbefore the end of the year
 three states had ratified the constitution delaware and new
jersey unanimously and pennsylvania after a short though savage
contest connecticut and georgia followed early the next year then came
the battle royal in massachusetts ending in ratification in february by
the narrow margin of  votes to  in the spring came the news that
maryland and south carolina were under the new roof on june  new
hampshire where the sentiment was at first strong enough to defeat the
constitution joined the new republic influenced by the favorable
decision in massachusetts swift couriers were sent to carry the news to
new york and virginia where the question of ratification was still
undecided nine states had accepted it and were united whether more saw
fit to join or not

meanwhile however virginia after a long and searching debate had
given her approval by a narrow margin leaving new york as the next seat
of anxiety in that state the popular vote for the delegates to the
convention had been clearly and heavily against ratification events
finally demonstrated the futility of resistance and hamilton by good
judgment and masterly arguments was at last able to marshal a majority
of thirty to twentyseven votes in favor of ratification

the great contest was over all the states except north carolina and
rhode island had ratified the sloop anarchy wrote an ebullient
journalist when last heard from was ashore on union rocks

the first electionin the autumn of  elections were held to
fill the places in the new government public opinion was overwhelmingly
in favor of washington as the first president yielding to the
importunities of friends he accepted the post in the spirit of public
service on april   he took the oath of office at federal hall
in new york city long live george washington president of the united
states cried chancellor livingston as soon as the general had kissed
the bible the cry was caught by the assembled multitude and given back
a new experiment in popular government was launched

chapter viii

the clash of political parties


the men and measures of the new government

friends of the constitution in powerin the first congress that
assembled after the adoption of the constitution there were eleven
senators led by robert morris the financier who had been delegates to
the national convention several members of the house of
representatives headed by james madison had also been at philadelphia
in  in making his appointments washington strengthened the new
system of government still further by a judicious selection of
officials he chose as secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton
who had been the most zealous for its success general knox head of the
war department and edmund randolph the attorneygeneral were likewise
conspicuous friends of the experiment every member of the federal
judiciary whom washington appointed from the chief justice john jay
down to the justices of the district courts had favored the
ratification of the constitution and a majority of them had served as
members of the national convention that framed the document or of the
state ratifying conventions only one man of influence in the new
government thomas jefferson the secretary of state was reckoned as a
doubter in the house of the faithful he had expressed opinions both for
and against the constitution but he had been out of the country acting
as the minister at paris when the constitution was drafted and ratified

an opposition to conciliatethe inauguration of washington amid the
plaudits of his countrymen did not set at rest all the political turmoil
which had been aroused by the angry contest over ratification the
interesting nature of the question wrote john marshall the equality
of the parties the animation produced inevitably by ardent debate had a
necessary tendency to embitter the dispositions of the vanquished and to
fix more deeply in many bosoms their prejudices against a plan of
government in opposition to which all their passions were enlisted the
leaders gathered around washington were well aware of the excited state
of the country they saw rhode island and north carolina still outside
of the union they knew by what small margins the constitution had
been approved in the great states of massachusetts virginia and new
york they were equally aware that a majority of the state conventions
in yielding reluctant approval to the constitution had drawn a number
of amendments for immediate submission to the states

the first amendmentsa bill of rightsto meet the opposition
madison proposed and the first congress adopted a series of amendments
to the constitution ten of them were soon ratified and became in  a
part of the law of the land these amendments provided among other
things that congress could make no law respecting the establishment of
religion abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right
of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a
redress of grievances they also guaranteed indictment by grand jury and
trial by jury for all persons charged by federal officers with serious
crimes to reassure those who still feared that local rights might be
invaded by the federal government the tenth amendment expressly
provided that the powers not delegated to the united states by the
constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the
states respectively or to the people seven years later the eleventh
amendment was written in the same spirit as the first ten after a
heated debate over the action of the supreme court in permitting a
citizen to bring a suit against the sovereign state of georgia the
new amendment was designed to protect states against the federal
judiciary by forbidding it to hear any case in which a state was sued by
a citizen

funding the national debtpaper declarations of rights however
paid no bills to this task hamilton turned all his splendid genius at
the very outset he addressed himself to the problem of the huge public
debt daily mounting as the unpaid interest accumulated in a report on
public credit under date of january   one of the first and
greatest of american state papers he laid before congress the outlines
of his plan he proposed that the federal government should call in all
the old bonds certificates of indebtedness and other promises to pay
which had been issued by the congress since the beginning of the
revolution these national obligations he urged should be put into one
consolidated debt resting on the credit of the united states to the
holders of the old paper should be issued new bonds drawing interest at
fixed rates this process was called funding the debt such a
provision for the support of public credit hamilton insisted would
satisfy creditors restore landed property to its former value and
furnish new resources to agriculture and commerce in the form of credit
and capital

assumption and funding of state debtshamilton then turned to the
obligations incurred by the several states in support of the revolution
these debts he proposed to add to the national debt they were to be
assumed by the united states government and placed on the same secure
foundation as the continental debt this measure he defended not merely
on grounds of national honor it would as he foresaw give strength to
the new national government by making all public creditors men of
substance in their several communities look to the federal rather than
the state government for the satisfaction of their claims

funding at face valueon the question of the terms of consolidation
assumption and funding hamilton had a firm conviction that millions
of dollars worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of
the hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the
support of the government or had sold supplies for the revolutionary
army was well known it was also a matter of common knowledge that a
very large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous
figuresten twenty and thirty cents on the dollar accordingly it
had been suggested even in very respectable quarters that a
discrimination should be made between original holders and speculative
purchasers some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who
had paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their
outlays and the original holders paid the difference others said that
the government should scale the debt by redeeming not at full value
but at a figure reasonably above the market price against the
proposition hamilton set his face like flint he maintained that the
government was honestly bound to redeem every bond at its face value
although the difficulty of securing revenue made necessary a lower rate
of interest on a part of the bonds and the deferring of interest on
another part

funding and assumption carriedthere was little difficulty in
securing the approval of both houses of congress for the funding of the
national debt at full value the bill for the assumption of state debts
however brought the sharpest division of opinions to the southern
members of congress assumption was a gross violation of states rights
without any warrant in the constitution and devised in the interest of
northern speculators who anticipating assumption and funding had
bought up at low prices the southern bonds and other promises to pay
new england on the other hand was strongly in favor of assumption
several representatives from that section were rash enough to threaten a
dissolution of the union if the bill was defeated to this dispute was
added an equally bitter quarrel over the location of the national
capital then temporarily at new york city

illustration first united states bank at philadelphia

a deadlock accompanied by the most surly feelings on both sides
threatened the very existence of the young government washington and
hamilton were thoroughly alarmed hearing of the extremity to which the
contest had been carried and acting on the appeal from the secretary of
the treasury jefferson intervened at this point by skillful management
at a good dinner he brought the opposing leaders together and thus once
more as on many other occasions peace was purchased and the union
saved by compromise the bargain this time consisted of an exchange of
votes for assumption in return for votes for the capital enough
southern members voted for assumption to pass the bill and a majority
was mustered in favor of building the capital on the banks of the
potomac after locating it for a tenyear period at philadelphia to
satisfy pennsylvania members

the united states bankencouraged by the success of his funding and
assumption measures hamilton laid before congress a project for a great
united states bank he proposed that a private corporation be chartered
by congress authorized to raise a capital stock of 
threefourths in new six per cent federal bonds and onefourth in
specie and empowered to issue paper currency under proper safeguards
many advantages hamilton contended would accrue to the government from
this institution the price of the government bonds would be increased
thus enhancing public credit a national currency would be created of
uniform value from one end of the land to the other the branches of the
bank in various cities would make easy the exchange of funds so vital to
commercial transactions on a national scale finally through the issue
of bank notes the money capital available for agriculture and industry
would be increased thus stimulating business enterprise jefferson
hotly attacked the bank on the ground that congress had no power
whatever under the constitution to charter such a private corporation
hamilton defended it with great cogency washington after weighing all
opinions decided in favor of the proposal in  the bill
establishing the first united states bank for a period of twenty years
became a law

the protective tariffa third part of hamiltons program was the
protection of american industries the first revenue act of  though
designed primarily to bring money into the empty treasury declared in
favor of the principle the following year washington referred to the
subject in his address to congress thereupon hamilton was instructed to
prepare recommendations for legislative action the result after a
delay of more than a year was his report on manufactures another
state paper worthy in closeness of reasoning and keenness of
understanding of a place beside his report on public credit hamilton
based his argument on the broadest national grounds the protective
tariff would by encouraging the building of factories create a home
market for the produce of farms and plantations by making the united
states independent of other countries in times of peace it would double
its security in time of war by making use of the labor of women and
children it would turn to the production of goods persons otherwise
idle or only partly employed by increasing the trade between the north
and south it would strengthen the links of union and add to political
ties those of commerce and intercourse the revenue measure of  bore
the impress of these arguments


the rise of political parties

dissensions over hamiltons measureshamiltons plans touching
deeply as they did the resources of individuals and the interests of the
states awakened alarm and opposition funding at face value said his
critics was a government favor to speculators the assumption of state
debts was a deep design to undermine the state governments congress had
no constitutional power to create a bank the law creating the bank
merely allowed a private corporation to make paper money and lend it at
a high rate of interest and the tariff was a tax on land and labor for
the benefit of manufacturers

hamiltons reply to this bill of indictment was simple and
straightforward some rascally speculators had profited from the funding
of the debt at face value but that was only an incident in the
restoration of public credit in view of the jealousies of the states it
was a good thing to reduce their powers and pretensions the
constitution was not to be interpreted narrowly but in the full light of
national needs the bank would enlarge the amount of capital so sorely
needed to start up american industries giving markets to farmers and
planters the tariff by creating a home market and increasing
opportunities for employment would benefit both land and labor out of
such wise policies firmly pursued by the government he concluded were
bound to come strength and prosperity for the new government at home
credit and power abroad this view washington fully indorsed adding
the weight of his great name to the inherent merits of the measures
adopted under his administration

the sharpness of the partisan conflictas a result of the clash of
opinion the people of the country gradually divided into two parties
federalists and antifederalists the former led by hamilton the latter
by jefferson the strength of the federalists lay in the citiesboston
providence hartford new york philadelphia charlestonamong the
manufacturing financial and commercial groups of the population who
were eager to extend their business operations the strength of the
antifederalists lay mainly among the debtburdened farmers who feared
the growth of what they called a money power and planters in all
sections who feared the dominance of commercial and manufacturing
interests the farming and planting south outside of the few towns
finally presented an almost solid front against assumption the bank
and the tariff the conflict between the parties grew steadily in
bitterness despite the conciliatory and engaging manner in which
hamilton presented his cause in his state papers and despite the
constant efforts of washington to soften the asperity of the
contestants

the leadership and doctrines of jeffersonthe party dispute had not
gone far before the opponents of the administration began to look to
jefferson as their leader some of hamiltons measures he had approved
declaring afterward that he did not at the time understand their
significance others particularly the bank he fiercely assailed more
than once he and hamilton shaking violently with anger attacked each
other at cabinet meetings and nothing short of the grave and dignified
pleas of washington prevented an early and open break between them in
 it finally came jefferson resigned as secretary of state and
retired to his home in virginia to assume through correspondence and
negotiation the leadership of the steadily growing party of opposition

shy and modest in manner halting in speech disliking the turmoil of
public debate and deeply interested in science and philosophy
jefferson was not very well fitted for the strenuous life of political
contest nevertheless he was an ambitious and shrewd negotiator he was
also by honest opinion and matured conviction the exact opposite of
hamilton the latter believed in a strong active hightoned
government vigorously compelling in all its branches jefferson looked
upon such government as dangerous to the liberties of citizens and
openly avowed his faith in the desirability of occasional popular
uprisings hamilton distrusted the people your people is a great
beast he is reported to have said jefferson professed his faith in
the people with an abandon that was considered reckless in his time

on economic matters the opinions of the two leaders were also
hopelessly at variance hamilton while cherishing agriculture desired
to see america a great commercial and industrial nation jefferson was
equally set against this course for his country he feared the
accumulation of riches and the growth of a large urban working class
the mobs of great cities he said are sores on the body politic
artisans are usually the dangerous element that make revolutions
workshops should be kept in europe and with them the artisans with their
insidious morals and manners the only substantial foundation for a
republic jefferson believed to be agriculture the spirit of
independence could be kept alive only by free farmers owning the land
they tilled and looking to the sun in heaven and the labor of their
hands for their sustenance trusting as he did in the innate goodness of
human nature when nourished on a free soil jefferson advocated those
measures calculated to favor agriculture and to enlarge the rights of
persons rather than the powers of government thus he became the
champion of the individual against the interference of the government
and an ardent advocate of freedom of the press freedom of speech and
freedom of scientific inquiry it was accordingly no mere factious
spirit that drove him into opposition to hamilton

the whisky rebellionthe political agitation of the antifederalists
was accompanied by an armed revolt against the government in  the
occasion for this uprising was another of hamiltons measures a law
laying an excise tax on distilled spirits for the purpose of increasing
the revenue needed to pay the interest on the funded debt it so
happened that a very considerable part of the whisky manufactured in the
country was made by the farmers especially on the frontier in their
own stills the new revenue law meant that federal officers would now
come into the homes of the people measure their liquor and take the
tax out of their pockets all the bitterness which farmers felt against
the fiscal measures of the government was redoubled in the western
districts of pennsylvania virginia and north carolina they refused to
pay the tax in pennsylvania some of them sacked and burned the houses
of the tax collectors as the revolutionists thirty years before had
mobbed the agents of king george sent over to sell stamps they were in
a fair way to nullify the law in whole districts when washington called
out the troops to suppress the whisky rebellion then the movement
collapsed but it left behind a deepseated resentment which flared up
in the election of several obdurate antifederalist congressmen from the
disaffected regions


foreign influences and domestic politics

the french revolutionin this exciting period when all america was
distracted by partisan disputes a storm broke in europethe
epochmaking french revolutionwhich not only shook the thrones of the
old world but stirred to its depths the young republic of the new world
the first scene in this dramatic affair occurred in the spring of 
a few days after washington was inaugurated the king of france louis
xvi driven into bankruptcy by extravagance and costly wars was forced
to resort to his people for financial help accordingly he called for
the first time in more than one hundred fifty years a meeting of the
national parliament the estates general composed of representatives
of the three estatesthe clergy nobility and commoners acting
under powerful leaders the commoners or third estate swept aside
the clergy and nobility and resolved themselves into a national
assembly this stirred the country to its depths

illustration from an old print

louis xvi in the hands of the mob

great events followed in swift succession on july   the
bastille an old royal prison symbol of the kings absolutism was
stormed by a paris crowd and destroyed on the night of august  the
feudal privileges of the nobility were abolished by the national
assembly amid great excitement a few days later came the famous
declaration of the rights of man proclaiming the sovereignty of the
people and the privileges of citizens in the autumn of  louis xvi
was forced to accept a new constitution for france vesting the
legislative power in a popular assembly little disorder accompanied
these startling changes to all appearances a peaceful revolution had
stripped the french king of his royal prerogatives and based the
government of his country on the consent of the governed

american influence in francein undertaking their great political
revolt the french had been encouraged by the outcome of the american
revolution officers and soldiers who had served in the american war
reported to their french countrymen marvelous tales at the frugal table
of general washington in council with the unpretentious franklin or at
conferences over the strategy of war french noblemen of ancient lineage
learned to respect both the talents and the simple character of the
leaders in the great republican commonwealth beyond the seas travelers
who had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes
carried home to the king and ruling class stories of an astounding
system of popular government

on the other hand the dalliance with american democracy was regarded by
french conservatives as playing with fire when we think of the false
ideas of government and philanthropy wrote one of lafayettes aides
which these youths acquired in america and propagated in france with so
much enthusiasm and such deplorable successfor this mania of imitation
powerfully aided the revolution though it was not the sole cause of
itwe are bound to confess that it would have been better both for
themselves and for us if these young philosophers in redheeled shoes
had stayed at home in attendance on the court

early american opinion of the french revolutionso close were the
ties between the two nations that it is not surprising to find every
step in the first stages of the french revolution greeted with applause
in the united states liberty will have another feather in her cap
exultantly wrote a boston editor in no part of the globe soberly
wrote john marshall was this revolution hailed with more joy than in
america but one sentiment existed the main key to the bastille
sent to washington as a memento was accepted as a token of the
victory gained by liberty thomas paine saw in the great event the
first ripe fruits of american principles transplanted into europe
federalists and antifederalists regarded the new constitution of france
as another vindication of american ideals

the reign of terrorwhile profuse congratulations were being
exchanged rumors began to come that all was not well in france many
noblemen enraged at the loss of their special privileges fled into
germany and plotted an invasion of france to overthrow the new system of
government louis xvi entered into negotiations with his brother
monarchs on the continent to secure their help in the same enterprise
and he finally betrayed to the french people his true sentiments by
attempting to escape from his kingdom only to be captured and taken
back to paris in disgrace

a new phase of the revolution now opened the working people excluded
from all share in the government by the first french constitution
became restless especially in paris assembling on the champs de mars
a great open field they signed a petition calling for another
constitution giving them the suffrage when told to disperse they
refused and were fired upon by the national guard this massacre as
it was called enraged the populace a radical party known as
jacobins then sprang up taking its name from a jacobin monastery in
which it held its sessions in a little while it became the master of
the popular convention convoked in september  the monarchy was
immediately abolished and a republic established on january  
louis was sent to the scaffold to the war on austria already raging
was added a war on england then came the reign of terror during which
radicals in possession of the convention executed in large numbers
counterrevolutionists and those suspected of sympathy with the
monarchy they shot down peasants who rose in insurrection against their
rule and established a relentless dictatorship civil war followed
terrible atrocities were committed on both sides in the name of liberty
and in the name of monarchy to americans of conservative temper it now
seemed that the revolution so auspiciously begun had degenerated into
anarchy and mere bloodthirsty strife

burke summons the world to war on francein england edmund burke
led the fight against the new french principles which he feared might
spread to all europe in his reflections on the french revolution
written in  he attacked with terrible wrath the whole program of
popular government he called for war relentless war upon the french
as monsters and outlaws he demanded that they be reduced to order by
the restoration of the king to full power under the protection of the
arms of european nations

paines defense of the french revolutionto counteract the campaign
of hate against the french thomas paine replied to burke in another of
his famous tracts the rights of man which was given to the american
public in an edition containing a letter of approval from jefferson
burke said paine had been mourning about the glories of the french
monarchy and aristocracy but had forgotten the starving peasants and the
oppressed people had wept over the plumage and neglected the dying
bird burke had denied the right of the french people to choose their
own governors blandly forgetting that the english government in which
he saw final perfection itself rested on two revolutions he had boasted
that the king of england held his crown in contempt of the democratic
societies paine answered if i ask a man in america if he wants a
king he retorts and asks me if i take him for an idiot to the charge
that the doctrines of the rights of man were new fangled paine
replied that the question was not whether they were new or old but
whether they were right or wrong as to the french disorders and
difficulties he bade the world wait to see what would be brought forth
in due time

the effect of the french revolution on american politicsthe course
of the french revolution and the controversies accompanying it
exercised a profound influence on the formation of the first political
parties in america the followers of hamilton now proud of the name
federalists drew back in fright as they heard of the cruel deeds
committed during the reign of terror they turned savagely upon the
revolutionists and their friends in america denouncing as jacobin
everybody who did not condemn loudly enough the proceedings of the
french republic a massachusetts preacher roundly assailed the
atheistical anarchical and in other respects immoral principles of the
french republicans he then proceeded with equal passion to attack
jefferson and the antifederalists whom he charged with spreading false
french propaganda and betraying america the editors patrons and
abettors of these vehicles of slander he exclaimed ought to be
considered and treated as enemies to their country of all traitors
they are the most aggravatedly criminal of all villains they are the
most infamous and detestable

the antifederalists as a matter of fact were generally favorable to
the revolution although they deplored many of the events associated with
it paines pamphlet indorsed by jefferson was widely read democratic
societies after the fashion of french political clubs arose in the
cities the coalition of european monarchs against france was denounced
as a coalition against the very principles of republicanism and the
execution of louis xvi was openly celebrated at a banquet in
philadelphia harmless titles such as sir the honorable and his
excellency were decried as aristocratic and some of the more excited
insisted on adopting the french title citizen speaking for example
of citizen judge and citizen toastmaster pamphlets in defense of
the french streamed from the press while subsidized newspapers kept the
propaganda in full swing

the european war disturbs american commercethis battle of wits or
rather contest in calumny might have gone on indefinitely in america
without producing any serious results had it not been for the war
between england and france then raging the english having command of
the seas claimed the right to seize american produce bound for french
ports and to confiscate american ships engaged in carrying french goods
adding fuel to a fire already hot enough they began to search american
ships and to carry off britishborn sailors found on board american
vessels

the french appeal for helpat the same time the french republic
turned to the united states for aid in its war on england and sent over
as its diplomatic representative citizen genet an ardent supporter of
the new order on his arrival at charleston he was greeted with fervor
by the antifederalists as he made his way north he was wined and
dined and given popular ovations that turned his head he thought the
whole country was ready to join the french republic in its contest with
england genet therefore attempted to use the american ports as the base
of operations for french privateers preying on british merchant ships
and he insisted that the united states was in honor bound to help france
under the treaty of 

the proclamation of neutrality and the jay treatyunmoved by the

rising tide of popular sympathy for france washington took a firm
course he received genet coldly the demand that the united states aid
france under the old treaty of alliance he answered by proclaiming the
neutrality of america and warning american citizens against hostile acts
toward either france or england when genet continued to hold meetings
issue manifestoes and stir up the people against england washington
asked the french government to recall him this act he followed up by
sending the chief justice john jay on a pacific mission to england

the result was the celebrated jay treaty of  by its terms great
britain agreed to withdraw her troops from the western forts where they
had been since the war for independence and to grant certain slight
trade concessions the chief sources of bitternessthe failure of the
british to return slaves carried off during the revolution the seizure
of american ships and the impressment of sailorswere not touched
much to the distress of everybody in america including loyal
federalists nevertheless washington dreading an armed conflict with
england urged the senate to ratify the treaty the weight of his
influence carried the day

at this the hostility of the antifederalists knew no bounds jefferson
declared the jay treaty an infamous act which is really nothing more
than an alliance between england and the anglomen of this country
against the legislature and the people of the united states hamilton
defending it with his usual courage was stoned by a mob in new york and
driven from the platform with blood streaming from his face jay was
burned in effigy even washington was not spared the house of
representatives was openly hostile to display its feelings it called
upon the president for the papers relative to the treaty negotiations
only to be more highly incensed by his flat refusal to present them on
the ground that the house did not share in the treatymaking power

washington retires from politicssuch angry contests confirmed the
president in his slowly maturing determination to retire at the end of
his second term in office he did not believe that a third term was
unconstitutional or improper but worn out by his long and arduous
labors in war and in peace and wounded by harsh attacks from former
friends he longed for the quiet of his beautiful estate at mount
vernon

in september  on the eve of the presidential election washington
issued his farewell address another state paper to be treasured and
read by generations of americans to come in this address he directed
the attention of the people to three subjects of lasting interest he
warned them against sectional jealousies he remonstrated against the
spirit of partisanship saying that in government of the popular
character in government purely elective it is a spirit not to be
encouraged he likewise cautioned the people against the insidious
wiles of foreign influence saying europe has a set of primary
interests which to us have none or a very remote relation hence she
must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are
essentially foreign to our concerns hence therefore it would be
unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary
vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions
of her friendships or enmities why forego the advantages of so
peculiar a situation it is our true policy to steer clear of
permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world taking
care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a
respectable defensive posture we may safely trust to temporary
alliances for extraordinary emergencies

the campaign of adams electedon hearing of the retirement of
washington the antifederalists cast off all restraints in honor of
france and in opposition to what they were pleased to call the
monarchical tendencies of the federalists they boldly assumed the name
republican the term democrat then applied only to obscure and
despised radicals had not come into general use they selected
jefferson as their candidate for president against john adams the
federalist nominee and carried on such a spirited campaign that they
came within four votes of electing him

the successful candidate adams was not fitted by training or opinion
for conciliating a determined opposition he was a reserved and studious
man he was neither a good speaker nor a skillful negotiator in one of
his books he had declared himself in favor of government by an
aristocracy of talents and wealthan offense which the republicans
never forgave while john marshall found him a sensible plain candid
goodtempered man jefferson could see in him nothing but a monocrat
and angloman had it not been for the conduct of the french
government adams would hardly have enjoyed a moments genuine
popularity during his administration

the quarrel with francethe french directory the executive
department established under the constitution of  managed however
to stir the anger of republicans and federalists alike it regarded the
jay treaty as a rebuke to france and a flagrant violation of obligations
solemnly registered in the treaty of  accordingly it refused to
receive the american minister treated him in a humiliating way and
finally told him to leave the country overlooking this affront in his
anxiety to maintain peace adams dispatched to france a commission of
eminent men with instructions to reach an understanding with the french
republic on their arrival they were chagrined to find instead of a
decent reception an indirect demand for an apology respecting the past
conduct of the american government a payment in cash and an annual
tribute as the price of continued friendship when the news of this
affair reached president adams he promptly laid it before congress
referring to the frenchmen who had made the demands as mr x mr y
and mr z

this insult coupled with the fact that french privateers like the
british were preying upon american commerce enraged even the
republicans who had been loudest in the profession of their french
sympathies they forgot their wrath over the jay treaty and joined with
the federalists in shouting millions for defense not a cent for
tribute preparations for war were made on every hand washington was
once more called from mount vernon to take his old position at the head
of the army indeed fighting actually began upon the high seas and went
on without a formal declaration of war until the year  by that time
the directory had been overthrown a treaty was readily made with
napoleon the first consul who was beginning his remarkable career as
chief of the french republic soon to be turned into an empire

alien and sedition lawsflushed with success the federalists
determined if possible to put an end to radical french influence in
america and to silence republican opposition they therefore passed two
drastic laws in the summer of  the alien and sedition acts

the first of these measures empowered the president to expel from the
country or to imprison any alien whom he regarded as dangerous or had
reasonable grounds to suspect of any treasonable or secret
machinations against the government

the second of the measures the sedition act penalized not only those
who attempted to stir up unlawful combinations against the government
but also every one who wrote uttered or published any false
scandalous and malicious writing  against the government of the
united states or either house of congress or the president of the
united states with intent to defame said government  or to bring
them or either of them into contempt or disrepute this measure was
hurried through congress in spite of the opposition and the clear
provision in the constitution that congress shall make no law abridging
the freedom of speech or of the press even many federalists feared the
consequences of the action hamilton was alarmed when he read the bill
exclaiming let us not establish a tyranny energy is a very different
thing from violence john marshall told his friends in virginia that
had he been in congress he would have opposed the two bills because he
thought them useless and calculated to create unnecessary discontents
and jealousies

the alien law was not enforced but it gave great offense to the irish
and french whose activities against the american governments policy
respecting great britain put them in danger of prison the sedition law
on the other hand was vigorously applied several editors of republican
newspapers soon found themselves in jail or broken by ruinous fines for
their caustic criticisms of the federalist president and his policies
bystanders at political meetings who uttered sentiments which though
ungenerous and severe seem harmless enough now were hurried before
federalist judges and promptly fined and imprisoned although the
prosecutions were not numerous they aroused a keen resentment the
republicans were convinced that their political opponents having
saddled upon the country hamiltons fiscal system and the british
treaty were bent on silencing all censure the measures therefore had
exactly the opposite effect from that which their authors intended
instead of helping the federalist party they made criticism of it more
bitter than ever

the kentucky and virginia resolutionsjefferson was quick to take
advantage of the discontent he drafted a set of resolutions declaring
the sedition law null and void as violating the federal constitution
his resolutions were passed by the kentucky legislature late in 
signed by the governor and transmitted to the other states for their
consideration though receiving unfavorable replies from a number of
northern states kentucky the following year reaffirmed its position and
declared that the nullification of all unconstitutional acts of congress
was the rightful remedy to be used by the states in the redress of
grievances it thus defied the federal government and announced a
doctrine hostile to nationality and fraught with terrible meaning for
the future in the neighboring state of virginia madison led a movement
against the alien and sedition laws he induced the legislature to pass
resolutions condemning the acts as unconstitutional and calling upon the
other states to take proper means to preserve their rights and the
rights of the people

the republican triumph in thus the way was prepared for the
election of  the republicans left no stone unturned in their
efforts to place on the federalist candidate president adams all the
odium of the alien and sedition laws in addition to responsibility for
approving hamiltons measures and policies the federalists divided in
councils and cold in their affection for adams made a poor campaign
they tried to discredit their opponents with epithets of jacobins and
anarchiststerms which had been weakened by excessive use when the
vote was counted it was found that adams had been defeated while the
republicans had carried the entire south and new york also and secured
eight of the fifteen electoral votes cast by pennsylvania our beloved
adams will now close his bright career lamented a federalist
newspaper sons of faction demagogues and high priests of anarchy now
you have cause to triumph

a quarrel between a federalist and a republican in the house of
representatives

jeffersons election however was still uncertain by a curious
provision in the constitution presidential electors were required to
vote for two persons without indicating which office each was to fill
the one receiving the highest number of votes to be president and the
candidate standing next to be vice president it so happened that aaron
burr the republican candidate for vice president had received the same
number of votes as jefferson as neither had a majority the election was
thrown into the house of representatives where the federalists held the
balance of power although it was well known that burr was not even a
candidate for president his friends and many federalists began
intriguing for his election to that high office had it not been for the
vigorous action of hamilton the prize might have been snatched out of
jeffersons hands not until the thirtysixth ballot on february 
 was the great issue decided in his favor

chapter ix

the jeffersonian republicans in power


republican principles and policies

opposition to strong central governmentcherishing especially the
agricultural interest as jefferson said the republicans were in the
beginning provincial in their concern and outlook their attachment to
america was certainly as strong as that of hamilton but they regarded
the state rather than the national government as the proper center of
power and affection indeed a large part of the rank and file had been
among the opponents of the constitution in the days of its adoption
jefferson had entertained doubts about it and monroe destined to be the
fifth president had been one of the bitter foes of ratification the
former went so far in the direction of local autonomy that he exalted
the state above the nation in the kentucky resolutions of 
declaring the constitution to be a mere compact and the states competent
to interpret and nullify federal law this was provincialism with a
vengeance it is jealousy not confidence which prescribes limited
constitutions wrote jefferson for the kentucky legislature jealousy
of the national government not confidence in itthis is the ideal that
reflected the provincial and agricultural interest

republican simplicityevery act of the jeffersonian party during its
early days of power was in accord with the ideals of government which it
professed it had opposed all pomp and ceremony calculated to give
weight and dignity to the chief executive of the nation as symbols of
monarchy and high prerogative appropriately therefore jeffersons
inauguration on march   the first at the new capital at
washington was marked by extreme simplicity in keeping with this
procedure he quit the practice followed by washington and adams of
reading presidential addresses to congress in joint assembly and adopted
in its stead the plan of sending his messages in writinga custom that
was continued unbroken until  when president wilson returned to the
example set by the first chief magistrate

republican measuresthe republicans had complained of a great
national debt as the source of a dangerous money power giving
strength to the federal government accordingly they began to pay it off
as rapidly as possible they had held commerce in low esteem and looked
upon a large navy as a mere device to protect it consequently they
reduced the number of warships they had objected to excise taxes
particularly on whisky these they quickly abolished to the intense
satisfaction of the farmers they had protested against the heavy cost
of the federal government they reduced expenses by discharging hundreds
of men from the army and abolishing many offices

they had savagely criticized the sedition law and jefferson refused to
enforce it they had been deeply offended by the assault on freedom of
speech and press and they promptly impeached samuel chase a justice of
the supreme court who had been especially severe in his attacks upon
offenders under the sedition act their failure to convict justice chase
by a narrow margin was due to no lack of zeal on their part but to the
federalist strength in the senate where the trial was held they had
regarded the appointment of a large number of federal judges during the
last hours of adams administration as an attempt to intrench
federalists in the judiciary and to enlarge the sphere of the national
government accordingly they at once repealed the act creating the new
judgeships thus depriving the midnight appointees of their posts
they had considered the federal offices civil and military as sources
of great strength to the federalists and jefferson though committed to
the principle that offices should be open to all and distributed
according to merit was careful to fill most of the vacancies as they
occurred with trusted republicans to his credit however it must be
said that he did not make wholesale removals to find room for party
workers

the republicans thus hewed to the line of their general policy of
restricting the weight dignity and activity of the national
government yet there were no republicans as the federalists asserted
prepared to urge serious modifications in the constitution if there be
any among us who wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican
form wrote jefferson in his first inaugural let them stand
undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may
be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it after reciting the
fortunate circumstances of climate soil and isolation which made the
future of america so full of promise jefferson concluded a wise and
frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another
shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of
industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the
bread it has earned this is the sum of good government and this is
necessary to close the circle of our felicities

in all this the republicans had not reckoned with destiny in a few
short years that lay ahead it was their fate to double the territory of
the country making inevitable a continental nation to give the
constitution a generous interpretation that shocked many a federalist
to wage war on behalf of american commerce to reestablish the hated
united states bank to enact a high protective tariff to see their
federalist opponents in their turn discredited as nullifiers and
provincials to announce high national doctrines in foreign affairs and
to behold the constitution exalted and defended against the pretensions
of states by a son of old virginia john marshall chief justice of the
supreme court of the united states


the republicans and the great west

expansion and land hungerthe first of the great measures which
drove the republicans out upon this new national coursethe purchase
of the louisiana territorywas the product of circumstances rather than
of their deliberate choosing it was not the lack of land for his
cherished farmers that led jefferson to add such an immense domain to
the original possessions of the united states in the northwest
territory now embracing ohio indiana illinois michigan wisconsin
and a portion of minnesota settlements were mainly confined to the
north bank of the ohio river to the south in kentucky and tennessee
where there were more than one hundred thousand white people who had
pushed over the mountains from virginia and the carolinas there were
still wide reaches of untilled soil the alabama and mississippi regions
were vast indian frontiers of the state of georgia unsettled and almost
unexplored even to the wildest imagination there seemed to be territory
enough to satisfy the land hunger of the american people for a century
to come

the significance of the mississippi riverat all events the east
then the center of power saw no good reason for expansion the planters
of the carolinas the manufacturers of pennsylvania the importers of
new york the shipbuilders of new england looking to the seaboard and
to europe for trade refinements and sometimes their ideas of
government were slow to appreciate the place of the west in national
economy the better educated the easterners were the less it seems
they comprehended the destiny of the nation sons of federalist fathers
at williams college after a long debate decided by a vote of fifteen to
one that the purchase of louisiana was undesirable

on the other hand the pioneers of kentucky ohio and tennessee
unlearned in books saw with their own eyes the resources of the
wilderness many of them had been across the mississippi and had beheld
the rich lands awaiting the plow of the white man down the great river
they floated their wheat corn and bacon to oceangoing ships bound for
the ports of the seaboard or for europe the land journeys over the
mountain barriers with bulky farm produce they knew from experience
were almost impossible and costly at best nails bolts of cloth tea
and coffee could go or come that way but not corn and bacon a free
outlet to the sea by the mississippi was as essential to the pioneers of
the kentucky region as the harbor of boston to the merchant princes of
that metropolis

louisiana under spanish rulefor this reason they watched with deep
solicitude the fortunes of the spanish king to whom at the close of the
seven years war had fallen the louisiana territory stretching from new
orleans to the rocky mountains while he controlled the mouth of the
mississippi there was little to fear for he had neither the army nor
the navy necessary to resist any invasion of american trade moreover
washington had been able by the exercise of great tact to secure from
spain in  a trading privilege through new orleans which satisfied
the present requirements of the frontiersmen even if it did not allay
their fears for the future so things stood when a swift succession of
events altered the whole situation

louisiana transferred to francein july  a royal order from
spain instructed the officials at new orleans to close the port to
american produce about the same time a disturbing rumor long current
was confirmednapoleon had coerced spain into returning louisiana to
france by a secret treaty signed in  the scalers of the alps and
conquerors of venice now looked across the sea for new scenes of
adventure the west was ablaze with excitement a call for war ran
through the frontier expeditions were organized to prevent the landing
of the french and petitions for instant action flooded in upon
jefferson

jefferson sees the dangerjefferson the friend of france and sworn
enemy of england compelled to choose in the interest of america never
winced the cession of louisiana and the floridas by spain to france
he wrote to livingston the american minister in paris works sorely on
the united states it completely reverses all the political relations of
the united states and will form a new epoch in our political course
there is on the globe one single spot the possessor of which is our
natural and habitual enemy it is new orleans through which the produce
of threeeighths of our territory must pass to market france
placing herself in that door assumes to us an attitude of defiance
spain might have retained it quietly for years her pacific
dispositions her feeble state would induce her to increase our
facilities there not so can it ever be in the hands of france
the day that france takes possession of new orleans fixes the sentence
which is to restrain her forever within her low water mark it seals
the union of the two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive
possession of the ocean from that moment we must marry ourselves to the
british fleet and nation this is not a state of things we seek or
desire it is one which this measure if adopted by france forces on us
as necessarily as any other cause by the laws of nature brings on its
necessary effect

louisiana purchasedacting on this belief but apparently seeing
only the mississippi outlet at stake jefferson sent his friend james
monroe to france with the power to buy new orleans and west florida
before monroe arrived the regular minister livingston had already
convinced napoleon that it would be well to sell territory which might
be wrested from him at any moment by the british sea power especially
as the war temporarily stopped by the peace of amiens was once more
raging in europe wise as he was in his day livingston had at first no
thought of buying the whole louisiana country he was simply dazed when
napoleon offered to sell the entire domain and get rid of the business
altogether though staggered by the proposal he and monroe decided to
accept on april  they signed the treaty of cession agreeing to pay
 in six per cent bonds and to discharge certain debts due
french citizens making in all approximately fifteen millions spain
protested napoleons brother fumed french newspapers objected but the
deed was done

jefferson and his constitutional scrupleswhen the news of this
extraordinary event reached the united states the people were filled
with astonishment and no one was more surprised than jefferson himself
he had thought of buying new orleans and west florida for a small sum
and now a vast domain had been dumped into the lap of the nation he was
puzzled on looking into the constitution he found not a line
authorizing the purchase of more territory and so he drafted an
amendment declaring louisiana as ceded by francea part of the
united states he had belabored the federalists for piling up a big
national debt and he could hardly endure the thought of issuing more
bonds himself

in the midst of his doubts came the news that napoleon might withdraw
from the bargain thoroughly alarmed by that jefferson pressed the
senate for a ratification of the treaty he still clung to his original
idea that the constitution did not warrant the purchase but he lamely
concluded if our friends shall think differently i shall certainly
acquiesce with satisfaction confident that the good sense of our
country will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill
effects thus the stanch advocate of strict interpretation cut loose
from his own doctrine and intrusted the construction of the constitution
to the good sense of his countrymen

the treaty ratifiedthis unusual transaction so favorable to the
west aroused the ire of the seaboard federalists some denounced it as
unconstitutional easily forgetting hamiltons masterly defense of the
bank also not mentioned in the constitution others urged that if the
howling wilderness ever should be settled it would turn against the
east form new commercial connections and escape from federal control
still others protested that the purchase would lead inevitably to the
dominance of a hotch potch of wild men from the far west federalists
who thought the broad back of america could readily bear hamiltons
consolidated debt now went into agonies over a bond issue of less than
onesixth of that amount but in vain jeffersons party with a high
hand carried the day the senate after hearing the federalist protest
ratified the treaty in december  the french flag was hauled down
from the old government buildings in new orleans and the stars and
stripes were hoisted as a sign that the land of coronado de soto
marquette and la salle had passed forever to the united states

illustration the united states in 

by a single stroke the original territory of the united states was more
than doubled while the boundaries of the purchase were uncertain it is
safe to say that the louisiana territory included what is now arkansas
missouri iowa oklahoma kansas nebraska south dakota and large
portions of louisiana minnesota north dakota colorado montana and
wyoming the farm lands that the friends of a little america on the
seacoast declared a hopeless wilderness were within a hundred years
fully occupied and valued at nearly seven billion dollarsalmost five
hundred times the price paid to napoleon

western explorationshaving taken the fateful step jefferson wisely
began to make the most of it he prepared for the opening of the new
country by sending the lewis and clark expedition to explore it
discover its resources and lay out an overland route through the
missouri valley and across the great divide to the pacific the story of
this mighty exploit which began in the spring of  and ended in the
autumn of  was set down with skill and pains in the journal of
lewis and clark when published even in a short form it invited the
forwardlooking men of the east to take thought about the western
empire at the same time zebulon pike in a series of journeys explored
the sources of the mississippi river and penetrated the spanish
territories of the far southwest thus scouts and pioneers continued the
work of diplomats


the republican war for commercial independence

the english and french blockadesin addition to bringing louisiana
to the united states the reopening of the european war in  after a
short lull renewed in an acute form the commercial difficulties that
had plagued the country all during the administrations of washington and
adams the republicans were now plunged into the hornets nest the
party whose ardent spirits had burned jay in effigy stoned hamilton for
defending his treaty jeered washingtons proclamation of neutrality
and spoken bitterly of timid traders could no longer take refuge in
criticism it had to act

its troubles took a serious turn in  england in a determined
effort to bring france to her knees by starvation declared the coast of
europe blockaded from brest to the mouth of the elbe river napoleon
retaliated by his berlin decree of november  blockading the
british islesa measure terrifying to american ship owners whose
vessels were liable to seizure by any french rover though napoleon had
no navy to make good his proclamation great britain countered with a
still more irritating decreethe orders in council of  it modified
its blockade but in so doing merely authorized american ships not
carrying munitions of war to complete their voyage to the continent on
condition of their stopping at a british port securing a license and
paying a tax this responded napoleon was the height of insolence and
he denounced it as a gross violation of international law he then
closed the circle of american troubles by issuing his milan decree of
december  this order declared that any ship which complied with
the british rules would be subject to seizure and confiscation by french
authorities

the impressment of seamenthat was not all great britain in dire
need of men for her navy adopted the practice of stopping american
ships searching them and carrying away britishborn sailors found on
board british sailors were so badly treated so cruelly flogged for
trivial causes and so meanly fed that they fled in crowds to the
american marine in many cases it was difficult to tell whether seamen
were english or american they spoke the same language so that language
was no test rovers on the deep and stragglers in the ports of both
countries they frequently had no papers to show their nativity
moreover great britain held to the old ruleonce an englishman
always an englishmana doctrine rejected by the united states in
favor of the principle that a man could choose the nation to which he
would give allegiance british sea captains sometimes by mistake and
often enough with reckless indifference carried away into servitude in
their own navy genuine american citizens the process itself even when
executed with all the civilities of law was painful enough for it
meant that american ships were forced to come to and compelled to
rest submissively under british guns until the searching party had pried
into records questioned seamen seized and handcuffed victims saints
could not have done this work without raising angry passions and only
saints could have endured it with patience and fortitude

had the enactment of the scenes been confined to the high seas and
knowledge of them to rumors and newspaper stories american resentment
might not have been so intense but many a search and seizure was made
in sight of land british and french vessels patrolled the coasts
firing on one another and chasing one another in american waters within
the threemile limit when in the summer of  the american frigate
chesapeake refused to surrender men alleged to be deserters from king
georges navy the british warship leopard opened fire killing three
men and wounding eighteen morean act which even the british ministry
could hardly excuse if the french were less frequently the offenders
it was not because of their tenderness about american rights but because
so few of their ships escaped the hawkeyed british navy to operate in
american waters

the losses in american commercethis highhanded conduct on the part
of european belligerents was very injurious to american trade by their
enterprise american shippers had become the foremost carriers on the
atlantic ocean in a decade they had doubled the tonnage of american
merchant ships under the american flag taking the place of the french
marine when britain swept that from the seas and supplying britain with
the sinews of war for the contest with the napoleonic empire the
american shipping engaged in foreign trade embraced  tons in
  tons in  and almost  tons in  such was
the enterprise attacked by the british and french decrees american
ships bound for great britain were liable to be captured by french
privateers which in spite of the disasters of the nile and trafalgar
ranged the seas american ships destined for the continent if they
failed to stop at british ports and pay tribute were in great danger of
capture by the sleepless british navy and its swarm of auxiliaries
american sea captains who in fear of british vengeance heeded the
orders in council and paid the tax were almost certain to fall a prey to
french vengeance for the french were vigorous in executing the milan
decree

jeffersons policythe presidents dilemma was distressing both the
belligerents in europe were guilty of depredations on american commerce
war on both of them was out of the question war on france was
impossible because she had no territory on this side of the water which
could be reached by american troops and her naval forces had been
shattered at the battles of the nile and trafalgar war on great
britain a power which jeffersons followers feared and distrusted was
possible but not inviting jefferson shrank from it a man of peace he
disliked wars brazen clamor a man of kindly spirit he was startled at
the death and destruction which it brought in its train so for the
eight years jefferson steered an even course suggesting measure after
measure with a view to avoiding bloodshed he sent it is true
commodore preble in  to punish mediterranean pirates preying upon
american commerce but a great war he evaded with passionate
earnestness trying in its place every other expedient to protect
american rights

the embargo and nonintercourse actsin  congress passed and
jefferson approved a nonimportation act closing american ports to
certain products from british dominionsa measure intended as a club
over the british governments head this law failing in its purpose
jefferson proposed and congress adopted in december  the embargo
act forbidding all vessels to leave american harbors for foreign ports
france and england were to be brought to terms by cutting off their
supplies

the result of the embargo was pathetic england and france refused to
give up search and seizure american ship owners who lured by huge
profits had formerly been willing to take the risk were now restrained
by law to their home ports every section suffered the south and west
found their markets for cotton rice tobacco corn and bacon
curtailed thus they learned by bitter experience the national
significance of commerce ship masters ship builders longshoremen and
sailors were thrown out of employment while the prices of foreign goods
doubled those who obeyed the law were ruined violators of the law
smuggled goods into canada and florida for shipment abroad

jeffersons friends accepted the medicine with a wry face as the only
alternative to supine submission or open war his opponents without
offering any solution of their own denounced it as a contemptible plan
that brought neither relief nor honor beset by the clamor that arose on
all sides congress in the closing days of jeffersons administration
repealed the embargo law and substituted a nonintercourse act
forbidding trade with england and france while permitting it with other
countriesa measure equally futile in staying the depredations on
american shipping

jefferson retires in favor of madisonjefferson exhausted by
endless wrangling and wounded as washington had been by savage
criticism welcomed march   his friends urged him to stay by the
ship and accept a third term he declined saying that election for
life might result from repeated reelection in following washingtons
course and defending it on principle he set an example to all his
successors making the third term doctrine a part of american
unwritten law

his intimate friend james madison to whom he turned over the burdens
of his high office was like himself a man of peace madison had been a
leader since the days of the revolution but in legislative halls and
council chambers not on the field of battle small in stature
sensitive in feelings studious in habits he was no man for the rough
and tumble of practical politics he had taken a prominent and
distinguished part in the framing and the adoption of the constitution
he had served in the first congress as a friend of hamiltons measures
later he attached himself to jeffersons fortunes and served for eight
years as his first counselor the secretary of state the principles of
the constitution which he had helped to make and interpret he was now
as president called upon to apply in one of the most perplexing moments
in all american history in keeping with his own traditions and
following in the footsteps of jefferson he vainly tried to solve the
foreign problem by negotiation

the trend of eventswhatever difficulties madison had in making up
his mind on war and peace were settled by events beyond his own control
in the spring of  a british frigate held up an american ship near
the harbor of new york and impressed a seaman alleged to be an american
citizen burning with resentment the captain of the president an
american warship acting under orders poured several broadsides into
the little belt a british sloop suspected of being the guilty party
the british also encouraged the indian chief tecumseh who welded
together the indians of the northwest under british protection and gave
signs of restlessness presaging a revolt this sent a note of alarm
along the frontier that was not checked even when in november
tecumsehs men were badly beaten at tippecanoe by william henry
harrison the indians stood in the way of the advancing frontier and it
seemed to the pioneers that without support from the british in canada
the red men would soon be subdued

clay and calhounwhile events were moving swiftly and rumors were
flying thick and fast the mastery of the government passed from the
uncertain hands of madison to a party of ardent young men in congress
dubbed young republicans under the leadership of two members destined
to be mighty figures in american history henry clay of kentucky and
john c calhoun of south carolina the former contended in a flair of
folly that the militia of kentucky alone are competent to place
montreal and upper canada at your feet the latter with a light heart
spoke of conquering canada in a four weeks campaign it must not be
inferred says channing that in advocating conquest the westerners
were actuated merely by desire for land they welcomed war because they

thought it would be the easiest way to abate indian troubles the
savages were supported by the furtrading interests that centred at
quebec and london the southerners on their part wished for florida
and they thought that the conquest of canada would obviate some northern
opposition to this acquisition of slave territory while clay and
calhoun spokesmen of the west and south were not unmindful of what
napoleon had done to american commerce they knew that their followers
still remembered with deep gratitude the aid of the french in the war
for independence and that the embers of the old hatred for george iii
still on the throne could be readily blown into flame

madison accepts war as inevitablethe conduct of the british
ministers with whom madison had to deal did little to encourage him in
adhering to the policy of watchful waiting one of them a high tory
believed that all americans were alike except that a few are less
knaves than others and his methods were colored by his belief on the
recall of this minister the british government selected another no less
high and mighty in his principles and opinions so madison became
thoroughly discouraged about the outcome of pacific measures when the
pressure from congress upon him became too heavy he gave way signing
on june   the declaration of war on great britain in
proclaiming hostilities the administration set forth the causes which
justified the declaration namely the british had been encouraging the
indians to attack american citizens on the frontier they had ruined
american trade by blockades they had insulted the american flag by
stopping and searching our ships they had illegally seized american
sailors and driven them into the british navy

the course of the warthe war lasted for nearly three years without
bringing victory to either side the surrender of detroit by general
hull to the british and the failure of the american invasion of canada
were offset by perrys victory on lake erie and a decisive blow
administered to british designs for an invasion of new york by way of
plattsburgh the triumph of jackson at new orleans helped to atone for
the humiliation suffered in the burning of the capitol by the british
the stirring deeds of the constitution the united states and the
argus on the seas the heroic death of lawrence and the victories of a
hundred privateers furnished consolation for those who suffered from the
iron blockade finally established by the british government when it came
to appreciate the gravity of the situation while men love the annals of
the sea they will turn to the running battles the narrow escapes and
the reckless daring of american sailors in that naval contest with great
britain

all this was exciting but it was inconclusive in fact never was a
government less prepared than was that of the united states in  it
had neither the disciplined troops the ships of war nor the supplies
required by the magnitude of the military task it was fortune that
favored the american cause great britain harassed worn and
financially embarrassed by nearly twenty years of fighting in europe
was in no mood to gather her forces for a titanic effort in america even
after napoleon was overthrown and sent into exile at elba in the spring
of  war clouds still hung on the european horizon and the conflict
temporarily halted did again break out to be rid of american anxieties
and free for european eventualities england was ready to settle with
the united states especially as that could be done without conceding
anything or surrendering any claims

the treaty of peaceboth countries were in truth sick of a war that
offered neither glory nor profit having indulged in the usual
diplomatic skirmishing they sent representatives to ghent to discuss
terms of peace after long negotiations an agreement was reached on
christmas eve  a few days before jacksons victory at new orleans
when the treaty reached america the people were surprised to find that
it said nothing about the seizure of american sailors the destruction
of american trade the searching of american ships or the support of
indians on the frontier nevertheless we are told the people passed
from gloom to glory when the news of peace arrived the bells were
rung schools were closed flags were displayed and many a rousing
toast was drunk in tavern and private home the rejoicing could
continue with napoleon definitely beaten at waterloo in june 
great britain had no need to impress sailors search ships and
confiscate american goods bound to the continent once more the terrible
sea power sank into the background and the ocean was again white with
the sails of merchantmen


the republicans nationalized

the federalists discreditedby a strange turn of fortunes wheel
the party of hamilton washington adams the party of the grand nation
became the party of provincialism and nullification new england
finding its shipping interests crippled in the european conflict and
then penalized by embargoes opposed the declaration of war on great
britain which meant the completion of the ruin already begun in the
course of the struggle the federalist leaders came perilously near to
treason in their efforts to hamper the government of the united states
and in their desperation they fell back upon the doctrine of
nullification so recently condemned by them when it came from kentucky
the senate of massachusetts while the war was in progress resolved
that it was waged without justifiable cause and refused to approve
military and naval projects not connected with the defense of our
seacoast and soil a boston newspaper declared that the union was
nothing but a treaty among sovereign states that states could decide
for themselves the question of obeying federal law and that armed
resistance under the banner of a state would not be rebellion or
treason the general assembly of connecticut reminded the administration
at washington that the state of connecticut is a free sovereign and
independent state gouverneur morris a member of the convention which
had drafted the constitution suggested the holding of another
conference to consider whether the northern states should remain in the
union

new england jumping into the hands of george iii

in october  a convention of delegates from connecticut
massachusetts rhode island and certain counties of new hampshire and
vermont was held at hartford on the call of massachusetts the counsels
of the extremists were rejected but the convention solemnly went on
record to the effect that acts of congress in violation of the
constitution are void that in cases of deliberate dangerous and
palpable infractions the state is duty bound to interpose its authority
for the protection of its citizens and that when emergencies occur the
states must be their own judges and execute their own decisions thus
new england answered the challenge of calhoun and clay fortunately its
actions were not as rash as its words the hartford convention merely
proposed certain amendments to the constitution and adjourned at the
close of the war its proposals vanished harmlessly but the men who
made them were hopelessly discredited

the second united states bankin driving the federalists towards
nullification and waging a national war themselves the republicans lost
all their old taint of provincialism moreover in turning to measures
of reconstruction called forth by the war they resorted to the national
devices of the federalists in  they chartered for a period of
twenty years a second united states bankthe institution which
jefferson and madison once had condemned as unsound and
unconstitutional the constitution remained unchanged times and
circumstances had changed calhoun dismissed the vexed question of
constitutionality with a scant reference to an ancient dispute while
madison set aside his scruples and signed the bill

the protective tariff of the republicans supplemented the bank
by another federalist measurea high protective tariff clay viewed it
as the beginning of his american system of protection calhoun
defended it on national principles for this sudden reversal of policy
the young republicans were taunted by some of their older party
colleagues with betraying the agricultural interest that jefferson had
fostered but calhoun refused to listen to their criticisms when the
seas are open he said the produce of the south may pour anywhere
into the markets of the old world what are the effects of a war with
a maritime powerwith england our commerce annihilated  our
agriculture cut off from its accustomed markets the surplus of the
farmer perishes on his hands the recent war fell with peculiar
pressure on the growers of cotton and tobacco and the other great
staples of the country and the same state of things will recur in the
event of another war unless prevented by the foresight of this body
when our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection as they soon
will be under the fostering care of the government we shall no longer
experience these evils with the republicans nationalized the
federalist party as an organization disappeared after a crushing
defeat in the presidential campaign of 

monroe and the florida purchaseto the victor in that political
contest james monroe of virginia fell two tasks of national
importance adding to the prestige of the whole country and deepening
the sense of patriotism that weaned men away from mere allegiance to
states the first of these was the purchase of florida from spain the
acquisition of louisiana let the mississippi flow unvexed to the sea
but it left all the states east of the river cut off from the gulf
affording them ground for discontent akin to that which had moved the
pioneers of kentucky to action a generation earlier the uncertainty as
to the boundaries of louisiana gave the united states a claim to west
florida setting on foot a movement for occupation the florida swamps
were a basis for indian marauders who periodically swept into the
frontier settlements and hiding places for runaway slaves thus the
sanction of international law was given to punitive expeditions into
alien territory

the pioneer leaders stood waiting for the signal it came president
monroe on the occasion of an indian outbreak ordered general jackson
to seize the offenders in the floridas if necessary the highspirited
warrior taking this as a hint that he was to occupy the coveted region
replied that if possession was the object of the invasion he could
occupy the floridas within sixty days without waiting for an answer to
this letter he launched his expedition and in the spring of  was
master of the spanish kings domain to the south

there was nothing for the king to do but to make the best of the
inevitable by ceding the floridas to the united states in return for
five million dollars to be paid to american citizens having claims
against spain on washingtons birthday  the treaty was signed it
ceded the floridas to the united states and defined the boundary between
mexico and the united states by drawing a line from the mouth of the
sabine river in a northwesterly direction to the pacific on this
occasion even monroe former opponent of the constitution forgot to
inquire whether new territory could be constitutionally acquired and
incorporated into the american union the republicans seemed far away
from the days of strict construction and jefferson still lived

the monroe doctrineeven more effective in fashioning the national
idea was monroes enunciation of the famous doctrine that bears his
name the occasion was another european crisis during the napoleonic
upheaval and the years of dissolution that ensued the spanish colonies
in america following the example set by their english neighbors in
 declared their independence unable to conquer them alone the
king of spain turned for help to the friendly powers of europe that
looked upon revolution and republics with undisguised horror

the holy alliancehe found them prepared to view his case with
sympathy three of them austria prussia and russia under the
leadership of the czar alexander i in the autumn of  had entered
into a holy alliance to sustain by reciprocal service the autocratic
principle in government although the effusive almost maudlin language
of the treaty did not express their purpose explicitly the alliance was
later regarded as a mere union of monarchs to prevent the rise and
growth of popular government

the american people thought their worst fears confirmed when in  a
conference of delegates from russia austria prussia and france met at
verona to consider among other things revolutions that had just broken
out in spain and italy the spirit of the conference is reflected in the
first article of the agreement reached by the delegates the high
contracting powers being convinced that the system of representative
government is equally incompatible with the monarchical principle and
the maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine right
mutually engage in the most solemn manner to use all their efforts to
put an end to the system of representative government in whatever
country it may exist in europe and to prevent its being introduced in
those countries where it is not yet known the czar who incidentally
coveted the west coast of north america proposed to send an army to aid
the king of spain in his troubles at home thus preparing the way for
intervention in spanish america it was material weakness not want of
spirit that prevented the grand union of monarchs from making open war
on popular government

the position of englandunfortunately too for the holy alliance
england refused to cooperate english merchants had built up a large
trade with the independent latinamerican colonies and they protested
against the restoration of spanish sovereignty which meant a renewal of
spains former trade monopoly moreover divine right doctrines had been
laid to rest in england and the representative principle thoroughly
established already there were signs of the coming democratic flood
which was soon to carry the first reform bill of  extending the
suffrage and sweep on to even greater achievements british statesmen
therefore had to be cautious in such circumstances instead of
cooperating with the autocrats of russia austria and prussia they
turned to the minister of the united states in london the british prime
minister canning proposed that the two countries join in declaring
their unwillingness to see the spanish colonies transferred to any other
power

jeffersons advicethe proposal was rejected but president monroe
took up the suggestion with madison and jefferson as well as with his
secretary of state john quincy adams they favored the plan jefferson
said one nation most of all could disturb us in this pursuit of
freedom she now offers to lead aid and accompany us in it by
acceding to her proposition we detach her from the bands bring her
mighty weight into the scale of free government and emancipate a
continent at one stroke with her on our side we need not fear the
whole world with her then we should most sedulously cherish a cordial
friendship

monroes statement of the doctrineacting on the advice of trusted
friends president monroe embodied in his message to congress on
december   a statement of principles now famous throughout the
world as the monroe doctrine to the autocrats of europe he announced
that he would regard any attempt on their part to extend their system
to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety
while he did not propose to interfere with existing colonies dependent
on european powers he ranged himself squarely on the side of those that
had declared their independence any attempt by a european power to
oppress them or control their destiny in any manner he characterized as
a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the united states
referring in another part of his message to a recent claim which the
czar had made to the pacific coast president monroe warned the old
world that the american continents by the free and independent
condition which they have assumed and maintained are henceforth not to
be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european
powers the effect of this declaration was immediate and profound men
whose political horizon had been limited to a community or state were
led to consider their nation as a great power among the sovereignties of
the earth taking its part in shaping their international relations

the missouri compromiserespecting one other important measure of
this period the republicans also took a broad view of their obligations
under the constitution namely the missouri compromise it is true
they insisted on the admission of missouri as a slave state balanced
against the free state of maine but at the same time they assented to
the prohibition of slavery in the louisiana territory north of the line
 o  during the debate on the subject an extreme view had been
presented to the effect that congress had no constitutional warrant for
abolishing slavery in the territories the precedent of the northwest
ordinance ratified by congress in  seemed a conclusive answer from
practice to this contention but monroe submitted the issue to his
cabinet which included calhoun of south carolina crawford of georgia
and wirt of virginia all presumably adherents to the jeffersonian
principle of strict construction he received in reply a unanimous
verdict to the effect that congress did have the power to prohibit
slavery in the territories governed by it acting on this advice he
approved on march   the bill establishing freedom north of the
compromise line this generous interpretation of the powers of congress
stood for nearly forty years until repudiated by the supreme court in
the dred scott case


the national decisions of chief justice marshall

john marshall the nationalistthe republicans in the lower ranges
of state politics who did not catch the grand national style of their
leaders charged with responsibilities in the national field were
assisted in their education by a federalist from the old dominion john
marshall who as chief justice of the supreme court of the united
states from  to  lost no occasion to exalt the constitution
above the claims of the provinces no differences of opinion as to his
political views have ever led even his warmest opponents to deny his
superb abilities or his sincere devotion to the national idea all will
likewise agree that for talents native and acquired he was an ornament
to the humble democracy that brought him forth his whole career was
american born on the frontier of virginia reared in a log cabin
granted only the barest rudiments of education inured to hardship and
rough life he rose by masterly efforts to the highest judicial honor
america can bestow

on him the bitter experience of the revolution and of later days made a
lasting impression he was no summer patriot he had been a soldier in
the revolutionary army he had suffered with washington at valley forge
he had seen his comrades in arms starving and freezing because the
continental congress had neither the power nor the inclination to force
the states to do their full duty to him the articles of confederation
were the symbol of futility into the struggle for the formation of the
constitution and its ratification in virginia he had thrown himself with
the ardor of a soldier later as a member of congress a representative
to france and secretary of state he had aided the federalists in
establishing the new government when at length they were driven from
power in the executive and legislative branches of the government he
was chosen for their last stronghold the supreme court by historic
irony he administered the oath of office to his bitterest enemy thomas
jefferson and long after the author of the declaration of independence
had retired to private life the stern chief justice continued to
announce the old federalist principles from the supreme bench

illustration john marshall

marbury vs madisonan act of congress annulledhe had been in
his high office only two years when he laid down for the first time in
the name of the entire court the doctrine that the judges have the power
to declare an act of congress null and void when in their opinion it
violates the constitution this power was not expressly conferred on the
court though many able men held that the judicial branch of the
government enjoyed it the principle was not positively established
until  when the case of marbury vs madison was decided in
rendering the opinion of the court marshall cited no precedents he
sought no foundations for his argument in ancient history he rested it
on the general nature of the american system the constitution ran his
reasoning is the supreme law of the land it limits and binds all who
act in the name of the united states it limits the powers of congress
and defines the rights of citizens if congress can ignore its
limitations and trespass upon the rights of citizens marshall argued
then the constitution disappears and congress is supreme since
however the constitution is supreme and superior to congress it is the
duty of judges under their oath of office to sustain it against
measures which violate it therefore from the nature of the american
constitutional system the courts must declare null and void all acts
which are not authorized a law repugnant to the constitution he
closed is void and the courts as well as other departments are bound
by that instrument from that day to this the practice of federal and
state courts in passing upon the constitutionality of laws has remained
unshaken

this doctrine was received by jefferson and many of his followers with
consternation if the idea was sound he exclaimed then indeed is our
constitution a complete felo de se legally a suicide for
intending to establish three departments coordinate and independent
that they might check and balance one another it has given according
to this opinion to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for
the government of the others and to that one too which is unelected
by and independent of the nation the constitution on this
hypothesis is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which
they may twist and shape into any form they please it should be
remembered as an axiom of eternal truth in politics that whatever
power in any government is independent is absolute also a judiciary
independent of a king or executive alone is a good thing but
independence of the will of the nation is a solecism at least in a
republican government but marshall was mighty and his view prevailed
though from time to time other men clinging to jeffersons opinion
likewise opposed the exercise by the courts of the high power of passing
upon the constitutionality of acts of congress

acts of state legislatures declared unconstitutionalhad marshall
stopped with annulling an act of congress he would have heard less
criticism from republican quarters but with the same firmness he set
aside acts of state legislatures as well whenever in his opinion they
violated the federal constitution in  in the case of fletcher
vs peck he annulled an act of the georgia legislature informing the
state that it was not sovereign but a part of a large empire  a
member of the american union and that union has a constitution 
which imposes limits to the legislatures of the several states in the
case of mcculloch vs maryland decided in  he declared void an
act of the maryland legislature designed to paralyze the branches of the
united states bank established in that state in the same year in the
still more memorable dartmouth college case he annulled an act of the
new hampshire legislature which infringed upon the charter received by
the college from king george long before that charter he declared was
a contract between the state and the college which the legislature
under the federal constitution could not impair two years later he
stirred the wrath of virginia by summoning her to the bar of the supreme
court to answer in a case in which the validity of one of her laws was
involved and then justified his action in a powerful opinion rendered in
the case of cohens vs virginia

all these decisions aroused the legislatures of the states they passed
sheaves of resolutions protesting and condemning but marshall never
turned and never stayed the constitution of the united states he
fairly thundered at them is the supreme law of the land the supreme
court is the proper tribunal to pass finally upon the validity of the
laws of the states and those sovereignties far from possessing the
right of review and nullification are irrevocably bound by the
decisions of that court this was strong medicine for the authors of the
kentucky and virginia resolutions and for the members of the hartford
convention but they had to take it

the doctrine of implied powerswhile restraining congress in the
marbury case and the state legislatures in a score of cases marshall
also laid the judicial foundation for a broad and liberal view of the
constitution as opposed to narrow and strict construction in mcculloch
vs maryland he construed generously the words necessary and proper
in such a way as to confer upon congress a wide range of implied
powers in addition to their express powers that case involved among
other things the question whether the act establishing the second
united states bank was authorized by the constitution marshall answered
in the affirmative congress ran his reasoning has large powers over
taxation and the currency a bank is of appropriate use in the exercise
of these enumerated powers and therefore though not absolutely
necessary a bank is entirely proper and constitutional with respect
to the means by which the powers that the constitution confers are to be
carried into execution he said congress must be allowed the
discretion which will enable that body to perform the high duties
assigned to it in the manner most beneficial to the people in short
the constitution of the united states is not a strait jacket but a
flexible instrument vesting in congress the powers necessary to meet
national problems as they arise in delivering this opinion marshall
used language almost identical with that employed by lincoln when
standing on the battle field of a war waged to preserve the nation he
said that a government of the people by the people for the people
shall not perish from the earth


summary of the union and national politics

during the strenuous period between the establishment of american
independence and the advent of jacksonian democracy the great american
experiment was under the direction of the men who had launched it all
the presidents in that period except john quincy adams had taken part
in the revolution james madison the chief author of the constitution
lived until  this age therefore was the age of the fathers it
saw the threatened ruin of the country under the articles of
confederation the formation of the constitution the rise of political
parties the growth of the west the second war with england and the
apparent triumph of the national spirit over sectionalism

the new republic had hardly been started in  before its troubles
began the government could not raise money to pay its debts or running
expenses it could not protect american commerce and manufactures
against european competition it could not stop the continual issues of
paper money by the states it could not intervene to put down domestic
uprisings that threatened the existence of the state governments
without money without an army without courts of law the union under
the articles of confederation was drifting into dissolution patriots
who had risked their lives for independence began to talk of monarchy
again washington hamilton and madison insisted that a new
constitution alone could save america from disaster

by dint of much labor the friends of a new form of government induced
the congress to call a national convention to take into account the
state of america in may  it assembled at philadelphia and for
months it debated and wrangled over plans for a constitution the small
states clamored for equal rights in the union the large states vowed
that they would never grant it a spirit of conciliation fair play and
compromise saved the convention from breaking up in addition there
were jealousies between the planting states and the commercial states
here too compromises had to be worked out some of the delegates
feared the growth of democracy and others cherished it these factions
also had to be placated at last a plan of government was draftedthe
constitution of the united statesand submitted to the states for
approval only after a long and acrimonious debate did enough states
ratify the instrument to put it into effect on april   george
washington was inaugurated first president

the new government proceeded to fund the old debt of the nation assume
the debts of the states found a national bank lay heavy taxes to pay
the bills and enact laws protecting american industry and commerce
hamilton led the way but he had not gone far before he encountered
opposition he found a formidable antagonist in jefferson in time two
political parties appeared full armed upon the scene the federalists
and the republicans for ten years they filled the country with
political debate in  the federalists were utterly vanquished by the
republicans with jefferson in the lead

by their proclamations of faith the republicans favored the states
rather than the new national government but in practice they added
immensely to the prestige and power of the nation they purchased
louisiana from france they waged a war for commercial independence
against england they created a second united states bank they enacted
the protective tariff of  they declared that congress had power to
abolish slavery north of the missouri compromise line and they spread
the shield of the monroe doctrine between the western hemisphere and
europe

still america was a part of european civilization currents of opinion
flowed to and fro across the atlantic friends of popular government in
europe looked to america as the great exemplar of their ideals events
in europe reacted upon thought in the united states the french
revolution exerted a profound influence on the course of political
debate while it was in the stage of mere reform all americans favored
it when the king was executed and a radical democracy set up american
opinion was divided when france fell under the military dominion of
napoleon and preyed upon american commerce the united states made ready
for war

the conduct of england likewise affected american affairs in  war
broke out between england and france and raged with only a slight
intermission until  england and france both ravaged american
commerce but england was the more serious offender because she had
command of the seas though jefferson and madison strove for peace the
country was swept into war by the vehemence of the young republicans
headed by clay and calhoun

when the armed conflict was closed one in diplomacy opened the
autocratic powers of europe threatened to intervene on behalf of spain
in her attempt to recover possession of her latinamerican colonies
their challenge to america brought forth the monroe doctrine the powers
of europe were warned not to interfere with the independence or the
republican policies of this hemisphere or to attempt any new
colonization in it it seemed that nationalism was to have a peaceful
triumph over sectionalism

part iv the west and jacksonian democracy




chapter x

the farmers beyond the appalachians


the nationalism of hamilton was undemocratic the democracy of jefferson
was in the beginning provincial the historic mission of uniting
nationalism and democracy was in the course of time given to new leaders
from a region beyond the mountains peopled by men and women from all
sections and free from those state traditions which ran back to the
early days of colonization the voice of the democratic nationalism
nourished in the west was heard when clay of kentucky advocated his
american system of protection for industries when jackson of tennessee
condemned nullification in a ringing proclamation that has taken its
place among the great american state papers and when lincoln of
illinois in a fateful hour called upon a bewildered people to meet the
supreme test whether this was a nation destined to survive or to perish
and it will be remembered that lincolns party chose for its banner that
earlier devicerepublicanwhich jefferson had made a sign of power
the rail splitter from illinois united the nationalism of hamilton
with the democracy of jefferson and his appeal was clothed in the
simple language of the people not in the sonorous rhetoric which
webster learned in the schools


preparation for western settlement

the west and the american revolutionthe excessive attention devoted
by historians to the military operations along the coast has obscured
the role played by the frontier in the american revolution the action
of great britain in closing western land to easy settlement in  was
more than an incident in precipitating the war for independence
americans on the frontier did not forget it when indians were employed
by england to defend that land zeal for the patriot cause set the
interior aflame it was the members of the western vanguard like daniel
boone john sevier and george rogers clark who first understood the
value of the faraway country under the guns of the english forts where
the red men still wielded the tomahawk and the scalping knife it was
they who gave the east no rest until their vision was seen by the
leaders on the seaboard who directed the course of national policy it
was one of their number a seasoned indian fighter george rogers clark
who with aid from virginia seized kaskaskia and vincennes and secured
the whole northwest to the union while the fate of washingtons army was
still hanging in the balance

western problems at the end of the revolutionthe treaty of peace
signed with great britain in  brought the definite cession of the
coveted territory west to the mississippi river but it left unsolved
many problems in the first place tribes of resentful indians in the
ohio region even though british support was withdrawn at last had to
be reckoned with and it was not until after the establishment of the
federal constitution that a wellequipped army could be provided to
guarantee peace on the border in the second place british garrisons
still occupied forts on lake erie pending the execution of the terms of
the treaty of terms which were not fulfilled until after the
ratification of the jay treaty twelve years later in the third place
virginia connecticut and massachusetts had conflicting claims to the
land in the northwest based on old english charters and indian treaties
it was only after a bitter contest that the states reached an agreement
to transfer their rights to the government of the united states
virginia executing her deed of cession on march   in the fourth
place titles to lands bought by individuals remained uncertain in the
absence of official maps and records to meet this last situation
congress instituted a systematic survey of the ohio country laying it
out into townships sections of  acres each and quarter sections in
every township one section of land was set aside for the support of
public schools

the northwest ordinancethe final problem which had to be solved
before settlement on a large scale could be begun was that of governing
the territory pioneers who looked with hungry eyes on the fertile
valley of the ohio could hardly restrain their impatience soldiers of
the revolution who had been paid for their services in land warrants
entitling them to make entries in the west called for action

congress answered by passing in  the famous northwest ordinance
providing for temporary territorial government to be followed by the
creation of a popular assembly as soon as there were five thousand free
males in any district eventual admission to the union on an equal
footing with the original states was promised to the new territories
religious freedom was guaranteed the safeguards of trial by jury
regular judicial procedure and habeas corpus were established in order
that the methods of civilized life might take the place of the
roughandready justice of lynch law during the course of the debate on
the ordinance congress added the sixth article forbidding slavery and
involuntary servitude

this charter of the northwest so well planned by the congress under the
articles of confederation was continued in force by the first congress
under the constitution in  the following year its essential
provisions except the ban on slavery were applied to the territory
south of the ohio ceded by north carolina to the national government
and in  to the mississippi territory once held by georgia thus it
was settled for all time that the new colonies were not to be exploited
for the benefit of the parent states any more than for the benefit of
england but were to be autonomous and coordinate commonwealths this
outcome bitterly opposed by some eastern leaders who feared the triumph
of western states over the seaboard completed the legal steps necessary
by way of preparation for the flood of settlers

the land companies speculators and western land tenureas in the
original settlement of america so in the opening of the west great
companies and single proprietors of large grants early figured in 
the ohio land company a new england concern acquired a million and a
half acres on the ohio and began operations by planting the town of
marietta a professional land speculator jc symmes secured a million
acres lower down where the city of cincinnati was founded other
individuals bought up soldiers claims and so acquired enormous holdings
for speculative purposes indeed there was such a rush to make fortunes
quickly through the rise in land values that washington was moved to cry
out against the rage for speculating in and forestalling of land on the
north west of the ohio protesting that scarce a valuable spot within
any tolerable distance of it is left without a claimant he therefore
urged congress to fix a reasonable price for the land not too
exorbitant and burdensome for real occupiers but high enough to
discourage monopolizers

congress however was not prepared to use the public domain for the
sole purpose of developing a body of small freeholders in the west it
still looked upon the sale of public lands as an important source of
revenue with which to pay off the public debt consequently it thought
more of instant income than of ultimate results it placed no limit on
the amount which could be bought when it fixed the price at  an acre
in  and it encouraged the professional land operator by making the
first installment only twenty cents an acre in addition to the small
registration and survey fee on such terms a speculator with a few
thousand dollars could get possession of an enormous plot of land if he
was fortunate in disposing of it he could meet the installments which
were spread over a period of four years and make a handsome profit for
himself even when the credit or installment feature was abolished in
 and the price of the land lowered to a cash price of  an acre
the opportunity for large speculative purchases continued to attract
capital to land ventures

the development of the small freeholdthe cheapness of land and the
scarcity of labor nevertheless made impossible the triumph of the huge
estate with its semiservile tenantry for about  a man could get a
farm of  acres on the installment plan another payment of  was
due in forty days but a fouryear term was allowed for the discharge of
the balance with a capital of from two to three hundred dollars a
family could embark on a land venture if it had good crops it could
meet the deferred payments it was however a hard battle at best many
a man forfeited his land through failure to pay the final installment
yet in the end in spite of all the handicaps the small freehold of a
few hundred acres at most became the typical unit of western
agriculture except in the planting states of the gulf even the lands
of the great companies were generally broken up and sold in small lots

the tendency toward moderate holdings so favored by western conditions
was also promoted by a clause in the northwest ordinance declaring that
the land of any person dying intestatethat is without any will
disposing of itshould be divided equally among his descendants
hildreth says of this provision it established the important
republican principle not then introduced into all the states of the
equal distribution of landed as well as personal property all these
forces combined made the wide dispersion of wealth in the early days of
the nineteenth century an american characteristic in marked contrast
with the european system of family prestige and vast estates based on
the law of primogeniture


the western migration and new states

the peoplewith government established federal arms victorious over
the indians and the lands surveyed for sale the way was prepared for
the immigrants they came with a rush young new englanders weary of
tilling the stony soil of their native states poured through new york
and pennsylvania some settling on the northern bank of the ohio but
most of them in the lake region sons and daughters of german farmers in
pennsylvania and many a redemptioner who had discharged his bond of
servitude pressed out into ohio kentucky tennessee or beyond from
the exhausted fields and the clay hills of the southern states came
pioneers of english and scotchirish descent the latter in great
numbers indeed one historian of high authority has ventured to say that
the rapid expansion of the united states from a coast strip to a
continental area is largely a scotchirish achievement while native
americans of mixed stocks led the way into the west it was not long
before immigrants direct from europe under the stimulus of company
enterprise began to filter into the new settlements in increasing
numbers

the types of people were as various as the nations they represented
timothy flint who published his entertaining recollections in 
found the west a strange mixture of all sorts and conditions of people
some of them he relates had been hunters in the upper world of the
mississippi above the falls of st anthony some had been still farther
north in canada still others had wandered from the souththe gulf of
mexico the red river and the spanish country french boatmen and
trappers spanish traders from the southwest virginia planters with
their droves of slaves mingled with english german and scotchirish
farmers hunters forest rangers restless bordermen and squatters
like the foaming combers of an advancing tide went first then followed
the farmers masters of the ax and plow with their wives who shared
every burden and hardship and introduced some of the features of
civilized life the hunters and rangers passed on to new scenes the
home makers built for all time

the number of immigrantsthere were no official stations on the
frontier to record the number of immigrants who entered the west during
the decades following the american revolution but travelers of the time
record that every road was crowded with pioneers and their families
their wagons and cattle and that they were seldom out of the sound of
the snapping whip of the teamster urging forward his horses or the crack
of the hunters rifle as he brought down his evening meal during the
latter half of  says coman more than nine hundred boats floated
down the ohio carrying eighteen thousand men women and children and
twelve thousand horses sheep and cattle and six hundred and fifty
wagons other lines of travel were also crowded and with the passing
years the flooding tide of home seekers rose higher and higher

the western routesfour main routes led into the country beyond the
appalachians the genesee road beginning at albany ran almost due west
to the present site of buffalo on lake erie through a level country in
the dry season wagons laden with goods could easily pass along it into
northern ohio a second route through pittsburgh was fed by three
eastern branches one starting at philadelphia one at baltimore and
another at alexandria a third main route wound through the mountains
from alexandria to boonesboro in kentucky and then westward across the
ohio to st louis a fourth the most famous of them all passed through
the cumberland gap and by branches extended into the cumberland valley
and the kentucky country

of these four lines of travel the pittsburgh route offered the most
advantages pioneers no matter from what section they came when once
they were on the headwaters of the ohio and in possession of a flatboat
could find a quick and easy passage into all parts of the west and
southwest whether they wanted to settle in ohio kentucky or western
tennessee they could find their way down the drifting flood to their
destination or at least to some spot near it many people from the south
as well as the northern and middle states chose this route so it came
about that the sons and daughters of virginia and the carolinas mingled
with those of new york pennsylvania and new england in the settlement
of the northwest territory

the methods of travel into the westmany stories giving exact
descriptions of methods of travel into the west in the early days have
been preserved the country was hardly opened before visitors from the
old world and from the eastern states impelled by curiosity made their
way to the very frontier of civilization and wrote books to inform or
amuse the public one of them gilbert imlay an english traveler has
given us an account of the pittsburgh route as he found it in  if
a man   he writes has a family or goods of any sort to remove his
best way then would be to purchase a waggon and team of horses to
carry his property to redstone old fort or to pittsburgh according as
he may come from the northern or southern states a good waggon will
cost at philadelphia about   and the horses about  each they
would cost something more both at baltimore and alexandria the waggon
may be covered with canvass and if it is the choice of the people they
may sleep in it of nights with the greatest safety but if they dislike
that there are inns of accommodation the whole distance on the
different roads the provisions i would purchase in the same manner
that is from the farmers along the road and by having two or three
camp kettles and stopping every evening when the weather is fine upon
the brink of some rivulet and by kindling a fire they may soon dress
their own food this manner of journeying is so far from being
disagreeable that in a fine season it is extremely pleasant the
immigrant once at pittsburgh or wheeling could then buy a flatboat of a
size required for his goods and stock and drift down the current to his
journeys end

the admission of kentucky and tennesseewhen the eighteenth century
drew to a close kentucky had a population larger than delaware rhode
island or new hampshire tennessee claimed  inhabitants in 
kentucky took her place as a state beside her none too kindly parent
virginia the eastern federalists resented her intrusion but they took
some consolation in the admission of vermont because the balance of
eastern power was still retained

as if to assert their independence of old homes and conservative ideas
the makers of kentuckys first constitution swept aside the landed
qualification on the suffrage and gave the vote to all free white males
four years later kentuckys neighbor to the south tennessee followed
this step toward a wider democracy after encountering fierce opposition
from the federalists tennessee was accepted as the sixteenth state

ohiothe door of the union had hardly opened for tennessee when
another appeal was made to congress this time from the pioneers in
ohio the little posts founded at marietta and cincinnati had grown into
flourishing centers of trade the stream of immigrants flowing down the
river added daily to their numbers and the growing settlements all
around poured produce into their markets to be exchanged for store
goods after the indians were disposed of in  and the last british
soldier left the frontier forts under the terms of the jay treaty of
 tiny settlements of families appeared on lake erie in the western
reserve a region that had been retained by connecticut when she
surrendered her other rights in the northwest

at the close of the century ohio claiming a population of more than
 grew discontented with its territorial status indeed two years
before the enactment of the northwest ordinance squatters in that
region had been invited by one john emerson to hold a convention after
the fashion of the men of hartford windsor and wethersfield in old
connecticut and draft a frame of government for themselves this true
son of new england declared that men have an undoubted right to pass
into every vacant country and there to form their constitution and that
from the confederation of the whole united states congress is not
empowered to forbid them this grand convention was never held because
the heavy hand of the government fell upon the leaders but the spirit
of john emerson did not perish in november  a convention chosen
by voters assembled under the authority of congress at chillicothe
drew up a constitution it went into force after a popular ratification
the roll of the convention bore such names as abbot baldwin cutler
huntington putnam and sargent and the list of counties from which
they came included adams fairfield hamilton jefferson trumbull and
washington showing that the new america in the west was peopled and led
by the old stock in  ohio was admitted to the union

indiana and illinoisas in the neighboring state the frontier in
indiana advanced northward from the ohio mainly under the leadership
however of settlers from the southrestless kentuckians hoping for
better luck in a newer country and pioneers from the far frontiers of
virginia and north carolina as soon as a tier of counties swinging
upward like the horns of the moon against ohio on the east and in the
wabash valley on the west was fairly settled a clamor went up for
statehood under the authority of an act of congress in  the
indianians drafted a constitution and inaugurated their government at
corydon the majority of the members of the convention we are told by
a local historian were frontier farmers who had a general idea of what
they wanted and had sense enough to let their more erudite colleagues
put it into shape

two years later the pioneers of illinois also settled upward from the
ohio like indiana elected their delegates to draft a constitution
leadership in the convention quite properly was taken by a man born in
new york and reared in tennessee and the constitution as finally
drafted was in its principal provisions a copy of the then existing
constitutions of kentucky ohio and indiana many of the articles
are exact copies in wording although differently arranged and
numbered

louisiana mississippi and alabamaacross the mississippi to the
far south clearing and planting had gone on with much bustle and
enterprise the cotton and sugar lands of louisiana opened by french
and spanish settlers were widened in every direction by planters with
their armies of slaves from the older states new orleans a good market
and a center of culture not despised even by the pioneer grew apace in
 the population of lower louisiana was over  the time had
come said the leaders of the people to fulfill the promise made to
france in the treaty of cession namely to grant to the inhabitants of
the territory statehood and the rights of american citizens federalists
from new england still having a voice in congress if somewhat weaker
still protested in tones of horror i am compelled to declare it as my
deliberate opinion pronounced josiah quincy in the house of
representatives that if this bill to admit louisiana passes the
bonds of this union are virtually dissolved  that as it will be the
right of all so it will be the duty of some states to prepare
definitely for a separation amicably if they can violently if they
must it is a death blow to the constitution it may afterwards
linger but lingering its fate will at no very distant period be
consummated federalists from new york like those from new england had
their doubts about the wisdom of admitting western states but the party
of jefferson and madison having the necessary majority granted the
coveted statehood to louisiana in 

when a few years later mississippi and alabama knocked at the doors of
the union the federalists had so little influence on account of their
conduct during the second war with england that spokesmen from the
southwest met a kindlier reception at washington mississippi in 
and alabama in  took their places among the united states of
america both of them while granting white manhood suffrage gave their
constitutions the tone of the old east by providing landed
qualifications for the governor and members of the legislature

missourifar to the north in the louisiana purchase a new
commonwealth was rising to power it was peopled by immigrants who came
down the ohio in fleets of boats or crossed the mississippi from
kentucky and tennessee thrifty germans from pennsylvania hardy farmers
from virginia ready to work with their own hands freemen seeking
freemens homes planters with their slaves moving on from wornout
fields on the seaboard came together in the widening settlements of the
missouri country peoples from the north and south flowed together
small farmers and big planters mingling in one community when their
numbers had reached sixty thousand or more they precipitated a contest
over their admission to the union ringing an alarm bell in the night
as jefferson phrased it the favorite expedient of compromise with
slavery was brought forth in congress once more maine consequently was
brought into the union without slavery and missouri with slavery at the
same time there was drawn westward through the rest of the louisiana
territory a line separating servitude from slavery


the spirit of the frontier

land tenure and libertyover an immense western area there developed
an unbroken system of freehold farms in the gulf states and the lower
mississippi valley it is true the planter with his many slaves even
led in the pioneer movement but through large sections of tennessee and
kentucky as well as upper georgia and alabama and all throughout the
northwest territory the small farmer reigned supreme in this immense
dominion there sprang up a civilization without caste or classa body
of people all having about the same amount of this worlds goods and
deriving their livelihood from one source the labor of their own hands
on the soil the northwest territory alone almost equaled in area all
the original thirteen states combined except georgia and its system of
agricultural economy was unbroken by plantations and feudal estates in
the subdivision of the soil and the great equality of condition as
webster said on more than one occasion lay the true basis most
certainly of popular government there was the undoubted source of
jacksonian democracy

illustration a log cabinlincolns birthplace

the characteristics of the western peopletravelers into the
northwest during the early years of the nineteenth century were agreed
that the people of that region were almost uniformly marked by the
characteristics common to an independent yeomanry a close observer thus
recorded his impressions a spirit of adventurous enterprise a
willingness to go through any hardship to accomplish an object
independence of thought and action they have felt the influence of
these principles from their childhood men who can endure anything that
have lived almost without restraint free as the mountain air or as the
deer and the buffalo of their forests and who know they are americans
all an apparent roughness which some would deem rudeness of
manner where there is perfect equality in a neighborhood of people
who know little about each others previous history or ancestry but
where each is lord of the soil he cultivates where a log cabin is all
that the best of families can expect to have for years and of course can
possess few of the external decorations which have so much influence in
creating a diversity of rank in society these circumstances have laid
the foundation for that equality of intercourse simplicity of manners
want of deference want of reserve great readiness to make
acquaintances freedom of speech indisposition to brook real or
imaginary insults which one witnesses among people of the west

this equality this independence this rudeness so often described by
the traveler as marking a new country were all accentuated by the
character of the settlers themselves traces of the fierce unsociable
eagleeyed harddrinking hunter remained the settlers who followed the
hunter were with some exceptions soldiers of the revolutionary army
farmers of the middling order and mechanics from the townsenglish
scotchirish germanspoor in possessions and thrown upon the labor of
their own hands for support sons and daughters from welltodo eastern
homes sometimes brought softer manners but the equality of life and the
leveling force of labor in forest and field soon made them one in spirit
with their struggling neighbors even the preachers and teachers who
came when the cabins were raised in the clearings and rude churches and
schoolhouses were built preached sermons and taught lessons that
savored of the frontier as any one may know who reads peter
cartwrights a muscular christian or egglestons the hoosier
schoolmaster


the west and the east meet

the east alarmeda people so independent as the westerners and so
attached to local selfgovernment gave the conservative east many a rude
shock setting gentlemen in powdered wigs and knee breeches agog with
the idea that terrible things might happen in the mississippi valley
not without good grounds did washington fear that a touch of a feather
would turn the western settlers away from the seaboard to the
spaniards and seriously did he urge the east not to neglect them lest
they be drawn into the arms of or be dependent upon foreigners
taking advantage of the restless spirit in the southwest aaron burr
having disgraced himself by killing alexander hamilton in a duel laid
wild plans if not to bring about a secession in that region at least
to build a state of some kind out of the spanish dominions adjoining
louisiana frightened at such enterprises and fearing the dominance of
the west the federalists with a few conspicuous exceptions opposed
equality between the sections had their narrow views prevailed the
west with its new democracy would have been held in perpetual tutelage
to the seaboard or perhaps been driven into independence as the thirteen
colonies had been not long before

eastern friends of the westfortunately for the nation there were
many eastern leaders particularly from the south who understood the
west approved its spirit and sought to bring the two sections together
by common bonds washington kept alive and keen the zeal for western
advancement which he acquired in his youth as a surveyor he never grew
tired of urging upon his eastern friends the importance of the lands
beyond the mountains he pressed upon the governor of virginia a project
for a wagon road connecting the seaboard with the ohio country and was
active in a movement to improve the navigation of the potomac he
advocated strengthening the ties of commerce smooth the roads he
said and make easy the way for them and then see what an influx of
articles will be poured upon us how amazingly our exports will be
increased by them and how amply we shall be compensated for any trouble
and expense we may encounter to effect it jefferson too was
interested in every phase of western developmentthe survey of lands
the exploration of waterways the opening of trade and even the
discovery of the bones of prehistoric animals robert fulton the
inventor of the steamboat was another man of vision who for many years
pressed upon his countrymen the necessity of uniting east and west by a
canal which would cement the union raise the value of the public lands
and extend the principles of confederate and republican government

the difficulties of early transportationmeans of communication
played an important part in the strategy of all those who sought to
bring together the seaboard and the frontier the produce of the
westwheat corn bacon hemp cattle and tobaccowas bulky and the
cost of overland transportation was prohibitive in the eastern market
a cow and her calf were given for a bushel of salt while a suit of
store clothes cost as much as a farm in such circumstances the
inhabitants of the mississippi valley were forced to ship their produce
over a long route by way of new orleans and to pay high freight rates
for everything that was brought across the mountains scows of from five
to fifty tons were built at the towns along the rivers and piloted down
the stream to the crescent city in a few cases small oceangoing
vessels were built to transport goods to the west indies or to the
eastern coast towns salt iron guns powder and the absolute
essentials which the pioneers had to buy mainly in eastern markets were
carried over narrow wagon trails that were almost impassable in the
rainy season

the national roadto farsighted men like albert gallatin the
father of internal improvements the solution of this problem was the
construction of roads and canals early in jeffersons administration
congress dedicated a part of the proceeds from the sale of lands to
building highways from the headwaters of the navigable waters emptying
into the atlantic to the ohio river and beyond into the northwest
territory in  after many misgivings it authorized a great
national highway binding the east and the west the cumberland road as
it was called began in northwestern maryland wound through southern
pennsylvania crossed the narrow neck of virginia at wheeling and then
shot almost straight across ohio indiana and illinois into missouri
by  stagecoaches were running between washington and wheeling by
 contractors had carried their work to columbus ohio and by 
to vandalia illinois over this ballasted road mail and passenger
coaches could go at high speed and heavy freight wagons proceed in
safety at a steady pace

illustration the cumberland road

canals and steamboatsa second epoch in the economic union of the
east and west was reached with the opening of the erie canal in 
offering an allwater route from new york city to the great lakes and
the mississippi valley pennsylvania alarmed by the advantages
conferred on new york by this enterprise began her system of canals and
portages from philadelphia to pittsburgh completing the last link in
 in the south the chesapeake and ohio company chartered in 
was busy with a project to connect georgetown and cumberland when
railways broke in upon the undertaking before it was half finished
about the same time ohio built a canal across the state affording
water communication between lake erie and the ohio river through a rich
wheat belt passengers could now travel by canal boat into the west with
comparative ease and comfort if not at a rapid speed and the bulkiest
of freight could be easily handled moreover the rate charged for
carrying goods was cut by the erie canal from  a ton per hundred
miles to  new orleans was destined to lose her primacy in the
mississippi valley

the diversion of traffic to eastern markets was also stimulated by
steamboats which appeared on the ohio about  three years after
fulton had made his famous trip on the hudson it took twenty men to
sail and row a fiveton scow up the river at a speed of from ten to
twenty miles a day in  timothy flint traveled a hundred miles a
day on the new steamer grecian against the whole weight of the
mississippi current three years later the round trip from louisville
to new orleans was cut to eight days heavy produce that once had to
float down to new orleans could be carried upstream and sent to the east
by way of the canal systems

thus the far country was brought near the timid no longer hesitated at
the thought of the perilous journey all routes were crowded with
western immigrants the forests fell before the ax like grain before the
sickle clearings scattered through the woods spread out into a great
mosaic of farms stretching from the southern appalachians to lake

four years later they sent a son of the soil from tennessee andrew

chapter xi

jacksonian democracy


the new england federalists at the hartford convention prophesied that
in time the west would dominate the east at the adoption of the
constitution they said a certain balance of power among the original
states was considered to exist and there was at that time and yet is
among those parties a strong affinity between their great and general
interests by the admission of these new states that balance has been
materially affected and unless the practice be modified must ultimately
be destroyed the southern states will first avail themselves of their
new confederates to govern the east and finally the western states
multiplied in number and augmented in population will control the
interests of the whole strangely enough the fulfillment of this
prophecy was being prepared even in federalist strongholds by the rise
of a new urban democracy that was to make common cause with the farmers
beyond the mountains


the democratic movement in the east

the aristocratic features of the old orderthe revolutionary
fathers in setting up their first state constitutions although they
often spoke of government as founded on the consent of the governed did
not think that consistency required giving the vote to all adult males
on the contrary they looked upon property owners as the only safe
depositary of political power they went back to the colonial
tradition that related taxation and representation this they argued
was not only just but a safeguard against the excesses of democracy

in carrying their theory into execution they placed taxpaying or
property qualifications on the right to vote broadly speaking these
limitations fell into three classes three states pennsylvania 
new hampshire  and georgia  gave the ballot to all who
paid taxes without reference to the value of their property three
virginia delaware and rhode island clung firmly to the ancient
principles that only freeholders could be intrusted with electoral
rights still other states while closely restricting the suffrage
accepted the ownership of other things as well as land in fulfillment of
the requirements in massachusetts for instance the vote was granted
to all men who held land yielding an annual income of three pounds or
possessed other property worth sixty pounds

the electors thus enfranchised numerous as they were owing to the wide
distribution of land often suffered from a very onerous disability in
many states they were able to vote only for persons of wealth because
heavy property qualifications were imposed on public officers in new
hampshire the governor had to be worth five hundred pounds onehalf in
land in massachusetts one thousand pounds all freehold in maryland
five thousand pounds one thousand of which was freehold in north
carolina one thousand pounds freehold and in south carolina ten
thousand pounds freehold a state senator in massachusetts had to be the
owner of a freehold worth three hundred pounds or personal property
worth six hundred pounds in new jersey one thousand pounds worth of
property in north carolina three hundred acres of land in south
carolina two thousand pounds freehold for members of the lower house
of the legislature lower qualifications were required

in most of the states the suffrage or office holding or both were
further restricted by religious provisions no single sect was powerful
enough to dominate after the revolution but for the most part
catholics and jews were either disfranchised or excluded from office
north carolina and georgia denied the ballot to any one who was not a
protestant delaware withheld it from all who did not believe in the
trinity and the inspiration of the scriptures massachusetts and
maryland limited it to christians virginia and new york advanced for
their day made no discrimination in government on account of religious
opinion

the defense of the old orderit must not be supposed that property
qualifications were thoughtlessly imposed at the outset or considered of
little consequence in practice in the beginning they were viewed as
fundamental as towns grew in size and the number of landless citizens
increased the restrictions were defended with even more vigor in
massachusetts the great webster upheld the rights of property in
government saying it is entirely just that property should have its
due weight and consideration in political arrangements the
disastrous revolutions which the world has witnessed those political
thunderstorms and earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society
to their deepest foundations have been revolutions against property
in pennsylvania a leader in local affairs cried out against a plan to
remove the taxpaying limitation on the suffrage what does the delegate
propose to place the vicious vagrant the wandering arabs the tartar
hordes of our large cities on the level with the virtuous and good man
in virginia jefferson himself had first believed in property
qualifications and had feared with genuine alarm the mobs of the great
cities it was near the end of the eighteenth century before he
accepted the idea of manhood suffrage even then he was unable to
convince the constitutionmakers of his own state it is not an idle
chimera of the brain urged one of them that the possession of land
furnishes the strongest evidence of permanent common interest with and
attachment to the community it is upon this foundation i wish to
place the right of suffrage this is the best general standard which can
be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the persons to be
invested with the right of suffrage are such persons as could be
consistently with the safety and wellbeing of the community intrusted
with the exercise of that right

attacks on the restricted suffragethe changing circumstances of
american life however soon challenged the rule of those with property
prominent among the new forces were the rising mercantile and business
interests where the freehold qualification was applied business men
who did not own land were deprived of the vote and excluded from office
in new york for example the most illiterate farmer who had one hundred
pounds worth of land could vote for state senator and governor while
the landless banker or merchant could not it is not surprising
therefore to find business men taking the lead in breaking down
freehold limitations on the suffrage the professional classes also were
interested in removing the barriers which excluded many of them from
public affairs it was a schoolmaster thomas dorr who led the popular
uprising in rhode island which brought the exclusive rule by freeholders
to an end

in addition to the business and professional classes the mechanics of
the towns showed a growing hostility to a system of government that
generally barred them from voting or holding office though not
numerous they had early begun to exercise an influence on the course of
public affairs they had led the riots against the stamp act overturned
king georges statue and crammed stamps down the throats of
collectors when the state constitutions were framed they took a lively
interest particularly in new york city and philadelphia in june 
the mechanicks in union in new york protested against putting the new
state constitution into effect without their approval declaring that
the right to vote on the acceptance or rejection of a fundamental law
is the birthright of every man to whatever state he may belong though
their petition was rejected their spirit remained when a few years
later the federal constitution was being framed the mechanics watched
the process with deep concern they knew that one of its main objects
was to promote trade and commerce affecting directly their daily bread
during the struggle over ratification they passed resolutions approving
its provisions and they often joined in parades organized to stir up
sentiment for the constitution even though they could not vote for
members of the state conventions and so express their will directly
after the organization of trade unions they collided with the courts of
law and thus became interested in the election of judges and lawmakers

those who attacked the old system of class rule found a strong moral
support in the declaration of independence was it not said that all men
are created equal whoever runs may read was it not declared that
governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed
that doctrine was applied with effect to george iii and seemed
appropriate for use against the privileged classes of massachusetts or
virginia how do the principles thus proclaimed asked the
nonfreeholders of richmond in petitioning for the ballot accord with
the existing regulation of the suffrage a regulation which instead of
the equality nature ordains creates an odious distinction between
members of the same community  and vests in a favored class not in
consideration of their public services but of their private possessions
the highest of all privileges

abolition of property qualificationsby many minor victories rather
than by any spectacular triumphs did the advocates of manhood suffrage
carry the day slight gains were made even during the revolution or
shortly afterward in pennsylvania the mechanics by taking an active
part in the contest over the constitution of  were able to force
the qualification down to the payment of a small tax vermont came into
the union in  without any property restrictions in the same year
delaware gave the vote to all men who paid taxes maryland reckoned one
of the most conservative of states embarked on the experiment of
manhood suffrage in  and nine years later connecticut equally
conservative decided that all taxpayers were worthy of the ballot

five states massachusetts new york virginia rhode island and north
carolina remained obdurate while these changes were going on around
them finally they had to yield themselves the last struggle in
massachusetts took place in the constitutional convention of  there
webster in the prime of his manhood and john adams in the closing
years of his old age alike protested against such radical innovations
as manhood suffrage their protests were futile the property test was
abolished and a small taxpaying qualification was substituted new york
surrendered the next year and after trying some minor restrictions for
five years went completely over to white manhood suffrage in 
rhode island clung to her freehold qualification through thirty years of
agitation then dorrs rebellion almost culminating in bloodshed
brought about a reform in  which introduced a slight taxpaying
qualification as an alternative to the freehold virginia and north
carolina were still unconvinced the former refused to abandon ownership
of land as the test for political rights until  and the latter until
 although religious discriminations and property qualifications for
office holders were sometimes retained after the establishment of
manhood suffrage they were usually abolished along with the monopoly of
government enjoyed by property owners and taxpayers

illustration thomas dorr arousing his followers

at the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century the white
male industrial workers and the mechanics of the northern cities at
least could lay aside the petition for the ballot and enjoy with the
free farmer a voice in the government of their common country
universal democracy sighed carlyle who was widely read in the united
states whatever we may think of it has declared itself the inevitable
fact of the days in which we live and he who has any chance to instruct
or lead in these days must begin by admitting that  where no
government is wanted save that of the parish constable as in america
with its boundless soil every man being able to find work and
recompense for himself democracy may subsist not elsewhere amid the
grave misgivings of the first generation of statesmen america was
committed to the great adventure in the populous towns of the east as
well as in the forests and fields of the west


the new democracy enters the arena

the spirit of the new order soon had a pronounced effect on the
machinery of government and the practice of politics the enfranchised
electors were not long in demanding for themselves a larger share in
administration

the spoils system and rotation in officefirst of all they wanted
office for themselves regardless of their fitness they therefore
extended the system of rewarding party workers with government
positionsa system early established in several states notably new
york and pennsylvania closely connected with it was the practice of
fixing short terms for officers and making frequent changes in
personnel long continuance in office explained a champion of this
idea in pennsylvania in  unfits a man for the discharge of its
duties by rendering him arbitrary and aristocratic and tends to beget
first life office and then hereditary office which leads to the
destruction of free government the solution offered was the historic
doctrine of rotation in office at the same time the principle of
popular election was extended to an increasing number of officials who
had once been appointed either by the governor or the legislature even
geologists veterinarians surveyors and other technical officers were
declared elective on the theory that their appointment smacked of
monarchy

popular election of presidential electorsin a short time the spirit
of democracy while playing havoc with the old order in state
government made its way upward into the federal system the framers of
the constitution bewildered by many proposals and unable to agree on
any single plan had committed the choice of presidential electors to
the discretion of the state legislatures the legislatures in turn
greedy of power early adopted the practice of choosing the electors
themselves but they did not enjoy it long undisturbed democracy
thundering at their doors demanded that they surrender the privilege to
the people reluctantly they yielded sometimes granting popular
election and then withdrawing it the drift was inevitable and the
climax came with the advent of jacksonian democracy in  vermont
new york delaware south carolina georgia and louisiana though some
had experimented with popular election still left the choice of
electors with the legislature eight years later south carolina alone
held to the old practice popular election had become the final word
the fanciful idea of an electoral college of good and wise men
selected without passion or partisanship by state legislatures acting as
deliberative bodies was exploded for all time the election of the
nations chief magistrate was committed to the tempestuous methods of
democracy

the nominating conventionas the suffrage was widened and the
popular choice of presidential electors extended there arose a violent
protest against the methods used by the political parties in nominating
candidates after the retirement of washington both the republicans and
the federalists found it necessary to agree upon their favorites before
the election and they adopted a colonial devicethe preelection
caucus the federalist members of congress held a conference and
selected their candidate and the republicans followed the example in
a short time the practice of nominating by a congressional caucus
became a recognized institution the election still remained with the
people but the power of picking candidates for their approval passed
into the hands of a small body of senators and representatives


a reaction against this was unavoidable to friends of the plain
people like andrew jackson it was intolerable all the more so
because the caucus never favored him with the nomination more
conservative men also found grave objections to it they pointed out
that whereas the constitution intended the president to be an
independent officer he had now fallen under the control of a caucus of
congressmen the supremacy of the legislative branch had been obtained
by an extralegal political device to such objections were added
practical considerations in  when personal rivalry had taken the
place of party conflicts the congressional caucus selected as the
candidate william h crawford of georgia a man of distinction but no
great popularity passing by such an obvious hero as general jackson
the followers of the general were enraged and demanded nothing short of
the death of king caucus their clamor was effective under their
attacks the caucus came to an ignominious end

in place of it there arose in  a new device the national nominating
convention composed of delegates elected by party voters for the sole
purpose of nominating candidates senators and representatives were
still prominent in the party councils but they were swamped by hundreds
of delegates fresh from the people as jackson was wont to say in
fact each convention was made up mainly of office holders and office
seekers and the new institution was soon denounced as vigorously as
king caucus had been particularly by statesmen who failed to obtain a
nomination still it grew in strength and by  was firmly
established

the end of the old generationin the election of  the
representatives of the aristocracy made their last successful stand
until then the leadership by men of wealth and talents had been
undisputed there had been five presidentswashington john adams
jefferson madison and monroeall eastern men brought up in prosperous
families with the advantages of culture which come from leisure and the
possession of lifes refinements none of them had ever been compelled
to work with his hands for a livelihood four of them had been
slaveholders jefferson was a philosopher learned in natural science a
master of foreign languages a gentleman of dignity and grace of manner
notwithstanding his studied simplicity madison it was said was armed
with all the culture of his century monroe was a graduate of william
and mary a gentleman of the old school jefferson and his three
successors called themselves republicans and professed a genuine faith
in the people but they were not of the people themselves they were
not sons of the soil or the workshop they were all men of the grand

old order of society who gave finish and style even to popular
government

monroe was the last of the presidents belonging to the heroic epoch of
the revolution he had served in the war for independence in the
congress under the articles of confederation and in official capacity
after the adoption of the constitution in short he was of the age that
had wrought american independence and set the government afloat with
his passing leadership went to a new generation but his successor
john quincy adams formed a bridge between the old and the new in that
he combined a high degree of culture with democratic sympathies
washington had died in  preceded but a few months by patrick henry
and followed in four years by samuel adams hamilton had been killed in
a duel with burr in  thomas jefferson and john adams were yet alive
in  but they were soon to pass from the scene reconciled at last
full of years and honors madison was in dignified retirement destined
to live long enough to protest against the doctrine of nullification
proclaimed by south carolina before death carried him away at the ripe
old age of eightyfive

the election of john quincy adams the campaign of  marked
the end of the era of good feeling inaugurated by the collapse of the
federalist party after the election of  there were four leading
candidates john quincy adams andrew jackson henry clay and wh
crawford the result of the election was a division of the electoral
votes into four parts and no one received a majority under the
constitution therefore the selection of president passed to the house
of representatives clay who stood at the bottom of the poll threw his
weight to adams and assured his triumph much to the chagrin of
jacksons friends they thought with a certain justification that
inasmuch as the hero of new orleans had received the largest electoral
vote the house was morally bound to accept the popular judgment and
make him president jackson shook hands cordially with adams on the day
of the inauguration but never forgave him for being elected

while adams called himself a republican in politics and often spoke of
the rule of the people he was regarded by jacksons followers as an
aristocrat he was not a son of the soil neither was he acquainted at
first hand with the labor of farmers and mechanics he had been educated
at harvard and in europe like his illustrious father john adams he
was a stern and reserved man little given to seeking popularity
moreover he was from the east and the frontiersmen of the west regarded
him as a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth jacksons
supporters especially disliked him because they thought their hero
entitled to the presidency their anger was deepened when adams
appointed clay to the office of secretary of state and they set up a
cry that there had been a deal by which clay had helped to elect adams
to get office for himself

though adams conducted his administration with great dignity and in a
fine spirit of public service he was unable to overcome the opposition
which he encountered on his election to office or to win popularity in
the west and south on the contrary by advocating government assistance
in building roads and canals and public grants in aid of education
arts and sciences he ran counter to the current which had set in
against appropriations of federal funds for internal improvements by
signing the tariff bill of  soon known as the tariff of
abominations he made new enemies without adding to his friends in new
york pennsylvania and ohio where he sorely needed them handicapped by
the false charge that he had been a party to a corrupt bargain with
clay to secure his first election attacked for his advocacy of a high
protective tariff charged with favoring an aristocracy of
officeholders in washington on account of his refusal to discharge
government clerks by the wholesale adams was retired from the white
house after he had served four years

the triumph of jackson in probably no candidate for the
presidency ever had such passionate popular support as andrew jackson
had in  he was truly a man of the people born of poor parents in
the upland region of south carolina schooled in poverty and adversity
without the advantages of education or the refinements of cultivated
leisure he seemed the embodiment of the spirit of the new american
democracy early in his youth he had gone into the frontier of tennessee
where he soon won a name as a fearless and intrepid indian fighter on
the march and in camp he endeared himself to his men by sharing their
hardships sleeping on the ground with them and eating parched corn
when nothing better could be found for the privates from local
prominence he sprang into national fame by his exploit at the battle of
new orleans his reputation as a military hero was enhanced by the
feeling that he had been a martyr to political treachery in  the
farmers of the west and south claimed him as their own the mechanics of
the eastern cities newly enfranchised also looked upon him as their
friend though his views on the tariff internal improvements and other
issues before the country were either vague or unknown he was readily
elected president

the returns of the electoral vote in  revealed the sources of
jacksons power in new england he received but one ballot from
maine he had a majority of the electors in new york and all of them in
pennsylvania and he carried every state south of maryland and beyond
the appalachians adams did not get a single electoral vote in the south
and west the prophecy of the hartford convention had been fulfilled

when jackson took the oath of office on march   the government of
the united states entered into a new era until this time the
inauguration of a presidenteven that of jefferson the apostle of
simplicityhad brought no rude shock to the course of affairs at the
capital hitherto the installation of a president meant that an
oldfashioned gentleman accompanied by a few servants had driven to
the white house in his own coach taken the oath with quiet dignity
appointed a few new men to the higher posts continued in office the
long list of regular civil employees and begun his administration with
respectable decorum jackson changed all this when he was inaugurated
men and women journeyed hundreds of miles to witness the ceremony great
throngs pressed into the white house upset the bowls of punch broke
the glasses and stood with their muddy boots on the satincovered
chairs to see the peoples president if jeffersons inauguration was
as he called it the great revolution jacksons inauguration was a
cataclysm


the new democracy at washington

the spoils systemthe staid and respectable society of washington
was disturbed by this influx of farmers and frontiersmen to speak of
politics became bad form among fashionable women the clerks and
civil servants of the government who had enjoyed long and secure tenure
of office became alarmed at the clamor of new men for their positions
doubtless the major portion of them had opposed the election of jackson
and looked with feelings akin to contempt upon him and his followers
with a hunters instinct jackson scented his prey determined to have
none but his friends in office he made a clean sweep expelling old
employees to make room for men fresh from the people this was a new
custom other presidents had discharged a few officers for engaging in
opposition politics they had been careful in making appointments not to
choose inveterate enemies but they discharged relatively few men on
account of their political views and partisan activities

by wholesale removals and the frank selection of officers on party
groundsa practice already well intrenched in new yorkjackson
established the spoils system at washington the famous slogan to
the victor belong the spoils of victory became the avowed principle of
the national government statesmen like calhoun denounced it poets like
james russell lowell ridiculed it faithful servants of the government
suffered under it but it held undisturbed sway for half a century
thereafter each succeeding generation outdoing if possible its
predecessor in the use of public office for political purposes if any
one remarked that training and experience were necessary qualifications
for important public positions he met jacksons own profession of
faith the duties of any public office are so simple or admit of being
made so simple that any man can in a short time become master of them

the tariff and nullificationjackson had not been installed in power
very long before he was compelled to choose between states rights and
nationalism the immediate occasion of the trouble was the tariffa
matter on which jackson did not have any very decided views his mind
did not run naturally to abstruse economic questions and owing to the
divided opinion of the country it was good politics to be vague and
ambiguous in the controversy especially was this true because the
tariff issue was threatening to split the country into parties again

the development of the policy of protectionthe war of  and
the commercial policies of england which followed it had accentuated the
need for american economic independence during that conflict the
united states cut off from english manufactures as during the
revolution built up home industries to meet the unusual call for iron
steel cloth and other military and naval supplies as well as the
demands from ordinary markets iron foundries and textile mills sprang
up as in the night hundreds of business men invested fortunes in
industrial enterprises so essential to the military needs of the
government and the people at large fell into the habit of buying
americanmade goods again as the london times tersely observed of the
americans their first war with england made them independent their
second war made them formidable

in recognition of this state of affairs the tariff of  was
designed first to prevent england from ruining these infant
industries by dumping the accumulated stores of years suddenly upon
american markets and secondly to enlarge in the manufacturing
centers the demand for american agricultural produce it accomplished
the purposes of its framers it kept in operation the mills and furnaces
so recently built it multiplied the number of industrial workers and
enhanced the demand for the produce of the soil it brought about
another very important result it turned the capital and enterprise of
new england from shipping to manufacturing and converted her statesmen
once friends of low tariffs into ardent advocates of protection

in the early years of the nineteenth century the yankees had bent their
energies toward building and operating ships to carry produce from
america to europe and manufactures from europe to america for this
reason they had opposed the tariff of  calculated to increase
domestic production and cut down the carrying trade defeated in their
efforts they accepted the inevitable and turned to manufacturing soon
they were powerful friends of protection for american enterprise as the
money invested and the labor employed in the favored industries
increased the demand for continued and heavier protection grew apace
even the farmers who furnished raw materials like wool flax and hemp
began to see eye to eye with the manufacturers so the textile interests
of new england the iron masters of connecticut new jersey and
pennsylvania the wool hemp and flax growers of ohio kentucky and
tennessee and the sugar planters of louisiana developed into a
formidable combination in support of a high protective tariff

the planting states oppose the tariffin the meantime the cotton
states on the seaboard had forgotten about the havoc wrought during the
napoleonic wars when their produce rotted because there were no ships to
carry it to europe the seas were now open the area devoted to cotton
had swiftly expanded as alabama mississippi and louisiana were opened
up cotton had in fact become king and the planters depended for their
prosperity as they thought upon the sale of their staple to english
manufacturers whose spinning and weaving mills were the wonder of the
world manufacturing nothing and having to buy nearly everything except
farm produce and even much of that for slaves the planters naturally
wanted to purchase manufactures in the cheapest market england where
they sold most of their cotton the tariff they contended raised the
price of the goods they had to buy and was thus in fact a tribute laid
on them for the benefit of the northern mill owners

the tariff of abominationsthey were overborne however in  and
again in  when northern manufacturers and western farmers forced
congress to make an upward revision of the tariff the act of  known
as the tariff of abominations though slightly modified in  was
the straw which broke the camels back southern leaders turned in
rage against the whole system the legislatures of virginia north
carolina south carolina georgia and alabama denounced it a general
convention of delegates held at augusta issued a protest of defiance
against it and south carolina weary of verbal battles decided to
prevent its enforcement

south carolina nullifies the tariffthe legislature of that state
on october   passed a bill calling for a state convention which
duly assembled in the following month in no mood for compromise it
adopted the famous ordinance of nullification after a few days debate
every line of this document was clear and firm the tariff it opened
gives bounties to classes and individuals  at the expense and to the
injury and oppression of other classes and individuals it is a
violation of the constitution of the united states and therefore null
and void its enforcement in south carolina is unlawful if the federal
government attempts to coerce the state into obeying the law the
people of this state will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all
further obligations to maintain or preserve their political connection
with the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to
organize a separate government and do all other acts and things which
sovereign and independent states may of right do

southern states condemn nullificationthe answer of the country to
this note of defiance couched in the language used in the kentucky
resolutions and by the new england federalists during the war of 
was quick and positive the legislatures of the southern states while
condemning the tariff repudiated the step which south carolina had
taken georgia responded we abhor the doctrine of nullification as
neither a peaceful nor a constitutional remedy alabama found it
unsound in theory and dangerous in practice north carolina replied
that it was revolutionary in character subversive of the constitution
of the united states mississippi answered it is disunion by
forceit is civil war virginia spoke more softly condemning the
tariff and sustaining the principle of the virginia resolutions but
denying that south carolina could find in them any sanction for her
proceedings

jackson firmly upholds the unionthe eyes of the country were turned
upon andrew jackson it was known that he looked with no friendly
feelings upon nullification for at a jefferson dinner in the spring of
 while the subject was in the air he had with laconic firmness
announced a toast our federal union it must be preserved when two
years later the open challenge came from south carolina he replied that
he would enforce the law saying with his frontier directness if a
single drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of
the united states i will hang the first man i can lay my hands on
engaged in such conduct upon the first tree that i can reach he made
ready to keep his word by preparing for the use of military and naval
forces in sustaining the authority of the federal government then in a
long and impassioned proclamation to the people of south carolina he
pointed out the national character of the union and announced his
solemn resolve to preserve it by all constitutional means nullification
he branded as incompatible with the existence of the union
contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized
by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was
founded and destructive of the great objects for which it was formed

a compromisein his messages to congress however jackson spoke the
language of conciliation a few days before issuing his proclamation he
suggested that protection should be limited to the articles of domestic
manufacture indispensable to safety in war time and shortly afterward
he asked for new legislation to aid him in enforcing the laws with two
propositions before it one to remove the chief grounds for south
carolinas resistance and the other to apply force if it was continued
congress bent its efforts to avoid a crisis on february  
henry clay laid before the senate a compromise tariff bill providing for
the gradual reduction of the duties until by  they would reach the
level of the law which calhoun had supported in  about the same
time the force bill designed to give the president ample authority in
executing the law in south carolina was taken up after a short but
acrimonious debate both measures were passed and signed by president
jackson on the same day march  looking upon the reduction of the
tariff as a complete vindication of her policy and an undoubted victory
south carolina rescinded her ordinance and enacted another nullifying
the force bill

the websterhayne debatewhere the actual victory lay in this
quarrel long the subject of high dispute need not concern us today
perhaps the chief result of the whole affair was a clarification of the
issue between the north and the southa definite statement of the
principles for which men on both sides were years afterward to lay down
their lives on behalf of nationalism and a perpetual union the stanch
old democrat from tennessee had in his proclamation on nullification
spoken a language that admitted of only one meaning on behalf of
nullification senator hayne of south carolina a skilled lawyer and
courtly orator had in a great speech delivered in the senate in
january  set forth clearly and cogently the doctrine that the
union is a compact among sovereign states from which the parties may
lawfully withdraw it was this address that called into the arena
daniel webster senator from massachusetts who spreading the mantle
of oblivion over the hartford convention delivered a reply to hayne
that has been reckoned among the powerful orations of all timea plea
for the supremacy of the constitution and the national character of the
union

the war on the united states bankif events forced the issue of
nationalism and nullification upon jackson the same could not be said
of his attack on the bank that institution once denounced by every
true jeffersonian had been reestablished in  under the
administration of jeffersons disciple james madison it had not been
in operation very long however before it aroused bitter opposition
especially in the south and the west its notes drove out of circulation
the paper currency of unsound banks chartered by the states to the
great anger of local financiers it was accused of favoritism in making
loans of conferring special privileges upon politicians in return for
their support at washington to all jacksons followers it was an
insidious money power one of them openly denounced it as an
institution designed to strengthen the arm of wealth and counterpoise
the influence of extended suffrage in the disposition of public
affairs

this sentiment president jackson fully shared in his first message to
congress he assailed the bank in vigorous language he declared that its
constitutionality was in doubt and alleged that it had failed to
establish a sound and uniform currency if such an institution was
necessary he continued it should be a public bank owned and managed
by the government not a private concern endowed with special privileges
by it in his second and third messages jackson came back to the
subject leaving the decision however to an enlightened people and
their representatives

moved by this frank hostility and anxious for the future the bank
applied to congress for a renewal of its charter in  four years
before the expiration of its life clay with his eye upon the
presidency and an issue for the campaign warmly supported the
application congress deeply impressed by his leadership passed the
bill granting the new charter and sent the open defiance to jackson
his response was an instant veto the battle was on and it raged with
fury until the close of his second administration ending in the
destruction of the bank a disordered currency and a national panic

in his veto message jackson attacked the bank as unconstitutional and
even hinted at corruption he refused to assent to the proposition that
the supreme court had settled the question of constitutionality by the
decision in the mcculloch case each public officer he argued who
takes an oath to support the constitution swears that he will support
it as he understands it not as it is understood by others

not satisfied with his veto and his declaration against the bank
jackson ordered the secretary of the treasury to withdraw the government
deposits which formed a large part of the institutions funds this
action he followed up by an open charge that the bank had used money
shamefully to secure the return of its supporters to congress the
senate stung by this charge solemnly resolved that jackson had
assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the
constitution and laws but in derogation of both

the effects of the destruction of the bank were widespread when its
charter expired in  banking was once more committed to the control
of the states the state legislatures under a decision rendered by the
supreme court after the death of marshall began to charter banks under
state ownership and control with full power to issue paper moneythis
in spite of the provision in the constitution that states shall not
issue bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin legal
tender in the payment of debts once more the country was flooded by
paper currency of uncertain value to make matters worse jackson
adopted the practice of depositing huge amounts of government funds in
these banks not forgetting to render favors to those institutions which
supported him in politicspet banks as they were styled at the
time in  partially though by no means entirely as a result of
the abolition of the bank the country was plunged into one of the most
disastrous panics which it ever experienced

internal improvements checkedthe bank had presented to jackson a
very clear problemone of destruction other questions were not so
simple particularly the subject of federal appropriations in aid of
roads and other internal improvements jefferson had strongly favored
government assistance in such matters but his administration was
followed by a reaction both madison and monroe vetoed acts of congress
appropriating public funds for public roads advancing as their reason
the argument that the constitution authorized no such laws jackson
puzzled by the clamor on both sides followed their example without
making the constitutional bar absolute congress he thought might
lawfully build highways of a national and military value but he
strongly deprecated attacks by local interests on the federal treasury

the triumph of the executive branchjacksons reelection in 
served to confirm his opinion that he was the chosen leader of the
people freed and instructed to ride rough shod over congress and even
the courts no president before or since ever entertained in times of
peace such lofty notions of executive prerogative the entire body of
federal employees he transformed into obedient servants of his wishes a
sign or a nod from him making and undoing the fortunes of the humble and
the mighty his lawful cabinet of advisers filling all of the high
posts in the government he treated with scant courtesy preferring
rather to secure his counsel and advice from an unofficial body of
friends and dependents who owing to their secret methods and back
stairs arrangements became known as the kitchen cabinet under the
leadership of a silent astute and resourceful politician amos
kendall this informal gathering of the faithful both gave and carried
out decrees and orders communicating the presidents lightest wish or
strictest command to the uttermost part of the country resolutely and
in the face of bitter opposition jackson had removed the deposits from
the united states bank when the senate protested against this arbitrary
conduct he did not rest until it was forced to expunge the resolution
of condemnation in time one of his lieutenants with his own hands was
able to tear the censure from the records when chief justice marshall
issued a decree against georgia which did not suit him jackson
according to tradition blurted out that marshall could go ahead and
enforce his own orders to the end he pursued his willful way finally
even choosing his own successor


the rise of the whigs

jacksons measures arouse oppositionmeasures so decided policies
so radical and conduct so highhanded could not fail to arouse against
jackson a deep and exasperated opposition the truth is the conduct of
his entire administration profoundly disturbed the business and finances
of the country it was accompanied by conditions similar to those which
existed under the articles of confederation a paper currency almost as
unstable and irritating as the worthless notes of revolutionary days
flooded the country hindering the easy transaction of business the use
of federal funds for internal improvements so vital to the exchange of
commodities which is the very life of industry was blocked by executive
vetoes the supreme court which under marshall had held refractory
states to their obligations under the constitution was flouted states
rights judges deliberately selected by jackson for the bench began to
sap and undermine the rulings of marshall the protective tariff under
which the textile industry of new england the iron mills of
pennsylvania and the wool flax and hemp farms of the west had
flourished had received a severe blow in the compromise of  which
promised a steady reduction of duties to cap the climax jacksons
party casting aside the old and reputable name of republican boldly
chose for its title the term democrat throwing down the gauntlet to
every conservative who doubted the omniscience of the people all these
things worked together to evoke an opposition that was sharp and
determined

illustration an old cartoon ridiculing clays tariff and internal
improvement program

clay and the national republicansin this opposition movement
leadership fell to henry clay a son of kentucky rather than to daniel
webster of massachusetts like jackson clay was born in a home haunted
by poverty left fatherless early and thrown upon his own resources he
went from virginia into kentucky where by sheer force of intellect he
rose to eminence in the profession of law without the martial gifts or
the martial spirit of jackson he slipped more easily into the social
habits of the east at the same time that he retained his hold on the
affections of the boisterous west farmers of ohio indiana and
kentucky loved him financiers of new york and philadelphia trusted him
he was thus a leader well fitted to gather the forces of opposition
into union against jackson

around clays standard assembled a motley collection representing every
species of political opinion united by one tie onlyhatred for old
hickory nullifiers and less strenuous advocates of states rights were
yoked with nationalists of websters school ardent protectionists were
bound together with equally ardent free traders all fraternizing in one
grand confusion of ideas under the title of national republicans thus
the ancient and honorable term selected by jefferson and his party now
abandoned by jacksonian democracy was adroitly adopted to cover the
supporters of clay the platform of the party however embraced all the
old federalist principles protection for american industry internal
improvements respect for the supreme court resistance to executive
tyranny and denunciation of the spoils system though jackson was
easily victorious in  the popular vote cast for clay should have
given him some doubts about the faith of the whole people in the
wisdom of his reign

van buren and the panic of nothing could shake the generals
superb confidence at the end of his second term he insisted on
selecting his own successor at a national convention chosen by party
voters but packed with his office holders and friends he nominated
martin van buren of new york once more he proved his strength by
carrying the country for the democrats with a fine flourish he
attended the inauguration of van buren and then retired amid the
applause and tears of his devotees to the hermitage his home in
tennessee

fortunately for him jackson escaped the odium of a disastrous panic
which struck the country with terrible force in the following summer
among the contributory causes of this crisis no doubt were the
destruction of the bank and the issuance of the specie circular of

 which required the purchasers of public lands to pay for them in
coin instead of the paper notes of state banks whatever the dominating
cause the ruin was widespread bank after bank went under boom towns
in the west collapsed eastern mills shut down and working people in
the industrial centers starving from unemployment begged for relief
van buren braved the storm offering no measure of reform or assistance
to the distracted people he did seek security for government funds by
suggesting the removal of deposits from private banks and the
establishment of an independent treasury system with government
depositaries for public funds in several leading cities this plan was
finally accepted by congress in 

had van buren been a captivating figure he might have lived down the
discredit of the panic unjustly laid at his door but he was far from
being a favorite with the populace though a man of many talents he
owed his position to the quiet and adept management of jackson rather
than to his own personal qualities the men of the frontier did not care
for him they suspected that he ate from gold plate and they could not
forgive him for being an astute politician from new york still the
democratic party remembering jacksons wishes renominated him
unanimously in  and saw him go down to utter defeat

the whigs and general harrisonby this time the national
republicans now known as whigsa title taken from the party of
opposition to the crown in england had learned many lessons taking a
leaf out of the democratic book they nominated not clay of kentucky
well known for his views on the bank the tariff and internal
improvements but a military hero general william henry harrison a man
of uncertain political opinions harrison a son of a virginia signer of
the declaration of independence sprang into public view by winning a
battle more famous than important tippecanoea brush with the
indians in indiana he added to his laurels by rendering praiseworthy
services during the war of  when days of peace returned he was
rewarded by a grateful people with a seat in congress then he retired
to quiet life in a little village near cincinnati like jackson he was
held to be a son of the south and the west like jackson he was a
military hero a lesser light but still a light like old hickory he
rode into office on a tide of popular feeling against an eastern man
accused of being something of an aristocrat his personal popularity was
sufficient the whigs who nominated him shrewdly refused to adopt a
platform or declare their belief in anything when some democrat
asserted that harrison was a backwoodsman whose sole wants were a jug of
hard cider and a log cabin the whigs treated the remark not as an
insult but as proof positive that harrison deserved the votes of jackson
men the jug and the cabin they proudly transformed into symbols of the
campaign and won for their chieftain  electoral votes while van
buren got only sixty

harrison and tylerthe hero of tippecanoe was not long to enjoy the
fruits of his victory the hungry horde of whig office seekers descended
upon him like wolves upon the fold if he went out they waylaid him if
he stayed indoors he was besieged not even his bed chamber was spared
he was none too strong at best and he took a deep cold on the day of his
inauguration between driving out democrats and appeasing whigs he fell
mortally ill before the end of a month he lay dead at the capitol

harrisons successor john tyler the vice president whom the whigs had
nominated to catch votes in virginia was more of a democrat than
anything else though he was not partisan enough to please anybody the
whigs railed at him because he would not approve the founding of another
united states bank the democrats stormed at him for refusing until
near the end of his term to sanction the annexation of texas which had
declared its independence of mexico in  his entire administration
marked by unseemly wrangling produced only two measures of importance
the whigs flushed by victory with the aid of a few protectionist
democrats enacted in  a new tariff law destroying the compromise
which had brought about the truce between the north and the south in
the days of nullification the distinguished leader of the whigs daniel
webster as secretary of state in negotiation with lord ashburton
representing great britain settled the longstanding dispute between
the two countries over the maine boundary a year after closing this
chapter in american diplomacy webster withdrew to private life leaving
the president to endure alone the buffets of political fortune

to the end the whigs regarded tyler as a traitor to their cause but
the judgment of history is that it was a case of the biter bitten they
had nominated him for the vice presidency as a man of views acceptable
to southern democrats in order to catch their votes little reckoning
with the chances of his becoming president tyler had not deceived them
and thoroughly soured he left the white house in  not to appear in
public life again until the days of secession when he espoused the
southern confederacy jacksonian democracy with new leadership serving
a new causeslaverywas returned to power under james k polk a
friend of the general from tennessee a few grains of sand were to run
through the hour glass before the whig party was to be broken and
scattered as the federalists had been more than a generation before


the interaction of american and european opinion

democracy in england and franceduring the period of jacksonian
democracy as in all epochs of ferment there was a close relation
between the thought of the new world and the old in england the
successes of the american experiment were used as arguments in favor of
overthrowing the aristocracy which george iii had manipulated with such
effect against america half a century before in the united states on
the other hand conservatives like chancellor kent the stout opponent
of manhood suffrage in new york cited the riots of the british working
classes as a warning against admitting the same classes to a share in
the government of the united states along with the agitation of opinion
went epochmaking events in  the year of jacksons second
triumph the british parliament passed its first reform bill which
conferred the ballotnot on workingmen as yetbut on mill owners and
shopkeepers whom the landlords regarded with genuine horror the initial
step was thus taken in breaking down the privileges of the landed
aristocracy and the rich merchants of england

about the same time a popular revolution occurred in france the bourbon
family restored to the throne of france by the allied powers after
their victory over napoleon in  had embarked upon a policy of
arbitrary government to use the familiar phrase they had learned
nothing and forgotten nothing charles x who came to the throne in
 set to work with zeal to undo the results of the french
revolution to stifle the press restrict the suffrage and restore the
clergy and the nobility to their ancient rights his policy encountered
equally zealous opposition and in  he was overthrown the popular
party under the leadership of lafayette established not a republic as
some of the radicals had hoped but a liberal middleclass monarchy
under louis philippe this second french revolution made a profound
impression on americans convincing them that the whole world was moving
toward democracy the mayor aldermen and citizens of new york city
joined in a great parade to celebrate the fall of the bourbons mingled
with cheers for the new order in france were hurrahs for the peoples
own andrew jackson the hero of new orleans and president of the united
states

european interest in americato the older and more settled
europeans the democratic experiment in america was either a menace or
an inspiration conservatives viewed it with anxiety liberals with
optimism farsighted leaders could see that the tide of democracy was
rising all over the world and could not be stayed naturally the country
that had advanced furthest along the new course was the place in which
to find arguments for and against proposals that europe should make
experiments of the same character

de tocquevilles democracy in americain addition to the casual
traveler there began to visit the united states the thoughtful observer
bent on finding out what manner of nation this was springing up in the
wilderness those who looked with sympathy upon the growing popular
forces of england and france found in the united states in spite of
many blemishes and defects a guarantee for the future of the peoples
rule in the old world one of these alexis de tocqueville a french
liberal of mildly democratic sympathies made a journey to this country
in  he described in a very remarkable volume democracy in
america the grand experiment as he saw it on the whole he was
convinced after examining with a critical eye the life and labor of the
american people as well as the constitutions of the states and the
nation he came to the conclusion that democracy with all its faults was
both inevitable and successful slavery he thought was a painful
contrast to the other features of american life and he foresaw what
proved to be the irrepressible conflict over it he believed that
through blundering the people were destined to learn the highest of all
arts selfgovernment on a grand scale the absence of a leisure class
devoted to no calling or profession merely enjoying the refinements of
life and adding to its gracesthe flaw in american culture that gave
deep distress to many a european leaderde tocqueville thought a
necessary virtue in the republic amongst a democratic people where
there is no hereditary wealth every man works to earn a living or has
worked or is born of parents who have worked a notion of labor is
therefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary natural
and honest condition of human existence it was this notion of a
government in the hands of people who labored that struck the french
publicist as the most significant fact in the modern world

harriet martineaus visit to americathis phase of american life
also profoundly impressed the brilliant english writer harriet
martineau she saw all parts of the country the homes of the rich and
the log cabins of the frontier she traveled in stagecoaches canal
boats and on horseback and visited sessions of congress and auctions
at slave markets she tried to view the country impartially and the
thing that left the deepest mark on her mind was the solidarity of the
people in one great political body however various may be the tribes
of inhabitants in those states whatever part of the world may have been
their birthplace or that of their fathers however broken may be their
language however servile or noble their employments however exalted or
despised their state all are declared to be bound together by equal
political obligations in that selfgoverning country all are held to
have an equal interest in the principles of its institutions and to be
bound in equal duty to watch their workings miss martineau was also
impressed with the passion of americans for land ownership and
contrasted the united states favorably with england where the tillers of
the soil were either tenants or laborers for wages

adverse criticismby no means all observers and writers were
convinced that america was a success the fastidious traveler mrs
trollope who thought the english system of church and state was ideal
saw in the united states only roughness and ignorance she lamented the
total and universal want of manners both in males and females adding
that while they appear to have clear heads and active intellects
there was no charm no grace in their conversation she found
everywhere a lack of reverence for kings learning and rank other
critics were even more savage the editor of the foreign quarterly
petulantly exclaimed that the united states was a brigand
confederation charles dickens declared the country to be so maimed
and lame so full of sores and ulcers that her best friends turn from
the loathsome creature in disgust sydney smith editor of the
edinburgh review was never tired of trying his caustic wit at the
expense of america their franklins and washingtons and all the other
sages and heroes of their revolution were born and bred subjects of the
king of england he observed in  during the thirty or forty
years of their independence they have done absolutely nothing for the
sciences for the arts for literature or even for the statesmanlike
studies of politics or political economy in the four quarters of the
globe who reads an american book or goes to an american play or looks
at an american picture or statue to put a sharp sting into his taunt
he added forgetting by whose authority slavery was introduced and
fostered under which of the old tyrannical governments of europe is
every sixth man a slave whom his fellow creatures may buy and sell

some americans while resenting the hasty and often superficial
judgments of european writers winced under their satire and took
thought about certain particulars in the indictments brought against
them the mass of the people however bent on the great experiment
gave little heed to carping critics who saw the flaws and not the
achievements of our countrycritics who were in fact less interested in
america than in preventing the rise and growth of democracy in europe

chapter xii

the middle border and the great west


we shall not send an emigrant beyond the mississippi in a hundred
years exclaimed livingston the principal author of the louisiana
purchase when he made this astounding declaration he doubtless had
before his minds eye the great stretches of unoccupied lands between
the appalachians and the mississippi he also had before him the history
of the english colonies which told him of the two centuries required to
settle the seaboard region to practical men his prophecy did not seem
far wrong but before the lapse of half that time there appeared beyond
the mississippi a tier of new states reaching from the gulf of mexico
to the southern boundary of minnesota and a new commonwealth on the
pacific ocean where american emigrants had raised the bear flag of
california


the advance of the middle border

missouriwhen the middle of the nineteenth century had been reached
the mississippi river which daniel boone the intrepid hunter had
crossed during washingtons administration to escape from civilization
in kentucky had become the waterway for a vast empire the center of
population of the united states had passed to the ohio valley missouri
with its wide reaches of rich lands lowlying level and fertile well
adapted to hemp raising had drawn to its borders thousands of planters
from the old southern statesfrom virginia and the carolinas as well as
from kentucky and tennessee when the great compromise of 
admitted her to the union wearing every jewel of sovereignty as a
florid orator announced migratory slave owners were assured that their
property would be safe in missouri along the western shore of the
mississippi and on both banks of the missouri to the uttermost limits of
the state plantations tilled by bondmen spread out in broad expanses
in the neighborhood of jefferson city the slaves numbered more than a
fourth of the population

into this stream of migration from the planting south flowed another
current of landtilling farmers some from kentucky tennessee and
mississippi driven out by the onrush of the planters buying and
consolidating small farms into vast estates and still more from the
east and the old world to the northwest over against iowa and to the
southwest against arkansas these yeomen laid out farms to be tilled by
their own labor in those regions the number of slaves seldom rose above
five or six per cent of the population the old french post st louis
enriched by the fur trade of the far west and the steamboat traffic of
the river grew into a thriving commercial city including among its
seventyfive thousand inhabitants in  nearly forty thousand
foreigners german immigrants from pennsylvania and europe being the
largest single element

arkansasbelow missouri lay the territory of arkansas which had
long been the paradise of the swarthy hunter and the restless
frontiersman fleeing from the advancing borders of farm and town in
search of the life wild and free where the rifle supplied the game and
a few acres of ground the corn and potatoes they had filtered into the
territory in an unending drift squatting on the land without so much
as asking the leave of any government territorial or national they
claimed as their own the soil on which they first planted their feet
like the cherokee indians whom they had as neighbors whose very
customs and dress they sometimes adopted the squatters spent their days
in the midst of rough plenty beset by chills fevers and the ills of
the flesh but for many years unvexed by political troubles or the
restrictions of civilized life

unfortunately for them however the fertile valleys of the mississippi
and arkansas were well adapted to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco
and their sylvan peace was soon broken by an invasion of planters the
newcomers with their servile workers spread upward in the valley
toward missouri and along the southern border westward to the red river
in time the slaves in the tier of counties against louisiana ranged from
thirty to seventy per cent of the population this marked the doom of
the small farmer swept arkansas into the main current of planting
politics and led to a powerful lobby at washington in favor of
admission to the union a boon granted in 

michiganin accordance with a wellestablished custom a free state
was admitted to the union to balance a slave state in  the people
of michigan a territory ten times the size of connecticut announced
that the time had come for them to enjoy the privileges of a
commonwealth all along the southern border the land had been occupied
largely by pioneers from new england who built prim farmhouses and
adopted the townmeeting plan of selfgovernment after the fashion of
the old home the famous post of detroit was growing into a flourishing
city as the boats plying on the great lakes carried travelers settlers
and freight through the narrows in all according to the census there
were more than ninety thousand inhabitants in the territory so it was
not without warrant that they clamored for statehood congress busy as
ever with politics delayed and the inhabitants of michigan unable to
restrain their impatience called a convention drew up a constitution
and started a lively quarrel with ohio over the southern boundary the
hand of congress was now forced objections were made to the new
constitution on the ground that it gave the ballot to all free white
males including aliens not yet naturalized but the protests were
overborne in a long debate the boundary was fixed and michigan though
shorn of some of the land she claimed came into the union in 

wisconsinacross lake michigan to the west lay the territory of
wisconsin which shared with michigan the interesting history of the
northwest running back into the heroic days when french hunters and
missionaries were planning a french empire for the great monarch louis
xiv it will not be forgotten that the french rangers of the woods the
blackrobed priests prepared for sacrifice even to death the trappers
of the french agencies and the french explorersmarquette joliet and
menardwere the first white men to paddle their frail barks through the
northern waters they first blazed their trails into the black forests
and left traces of their work in the names of portages and little
villages it was from these forests that red men in full war paint
journeyed far to fight under the fleurdelis of france when the
soldiers of king louis made their last stand at quebec and montreal
against the imperial arms of britain it was here that the british flag
was planted in  and that the great pontiac conspiracy was formed two
years later to overthrow british dominion

when a generation afterward the stars and stripes supplanted the union
jack the french were still almost the only white men in the region
they were soon joined by hustling yankee fur traders who did battle
royal against british interlopers the traders cut their way through
forest trails and laid out the routes through lake and stream and over
portages for the settlers and their families from the states back
east it was the forest ranger who discovered the water power later
used to turn the busy mills grinding the grain from the spreading farm
lands in the wake of the fur hunters forest men and farmers came
miners from kentucky tennessee and missouri crowding in to exploit the
lead ores of the northwest some of them bringing slaves to work their
claims had it not been for the gold fever of  that drew the
wielders of pick and shovel to the far west wisconsin would early have
taken high rank among the mining regions of the country

from a favorable point of vantage on lake michigan the village of
milwaukee a center for lumber and grain transport and a place of entry
for eastern goods grew into a thriving city it claimed twenty thousand
inhabitants when in  congress admitted wisconsin to the union
already the germans irish and scandinavians had found their way into
the territory they joined americans from the older states in clearing
forests building roads transforming trails into highways erecting
mills and connecting streams with canals to make a network of routes
for the traffic that poured to and from the great lakes

iowa and minnesotato the southwest of wisconsin beyond the
mississippi where the tall grass of the prairies waved like the sea
farmers from new england new york and ohio had prepared iowa for
statehood a tide of immigration that might have flowed into missouri
went northward for freemen unaccustomed to slavery and slave markets
preferred the open country above the compromise line with incredible
swiftness they spread farms westward from the mississippi with yankee
ingenuity they turned to trading on the river building before 
three prosperous centers of traffic dubuque davenport and burlington
true to their old traditions they founded colleges and academies that
religion and learning might be cherished on the frontier as in the
states from which they came prepared for selfgovernment the iowans
laid siege to the door of congress and were admitted to the union in


above iowa on the mississippi lay the territory of minnesotathe home
of the dakotas the ojibways and the sioux like michigan and
wisconsin it had been explored early by the french scouts and the
first white settlement was the little french village of mendota to the
people of the united states the resources of the country were first
revealed by the historic journey of zebulon pike in  and by american
fur traders who were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to ply
their arts of hunting and bartering in fresh fields in  an
american settlement was planted at marina on the st croix the outpost
of advancing civilization within twenty years the territory boasting
a population of  asked for admission to the union in  the
plea was granted and minnesota showed her gratitude three years later by
being first among the states to offer troops to lincoln in the hour of
peril


on to the pacifictexas and the mexican war

the uniformity of the middle westthere was a certain monotony about
pioneering in the northwest and on the middle border as the long
stretches of land were cleared or prepared for the plow they were laid
out like checkerboards into squares of forty eighty one hundred sixty
or more acres each the seat of a homestead there was a striking
uniformity also about the endless succession of fertile fields spreading
far and wide under the hot summer sun no majestic mountains relieved
the sweep of the prairie few monuments of other races and antiquity
were there to awaken curiosity about the region no sonorous bells in
old missions rang out the time of day the chaffering red man bartering
blankets and furs for powder and whisky had passed farther on the
population was made up of plain farmers and their families engaged in
severe and unbroken labor chopping down trees draining feverbreeding
swamps breaking new ground and planting from year to year the same
rotation of crops nearly all the settlers were of native american stock
into whose frugal and industrious lives the later irish and german
immigrants fitted on the whole with little friction even the dutch
oven fell before the castiron cooking stove happiness and sorrow
despair and hope were there but all encompassed by the heavy tedium of
prosaic sameness

a contrast in the far west and southwestas george rogers clark and
daniel boone had stirred the snug americans of the seaboard to seek
their fortunes beyond the appalachians so now kit carson james bowie
sam houston davy crockett and john c fremont were to lead the way
into a new land only a part of which was under the american flag the
setting for this new scene in the westward movement was thrown out in a
wide sweep from the headwaters of the mississippi to the banks of the
rio grande from the valleys of the sabine and red rivers to montana and
the pacific slope in comparison with the middle border this region
presented such startling diversities that only the eye of faith could
foresee the unifying power of nationalism binding its communities with
the older sections of the country what contrasts indeed the blue grass
region of kentucky or the rich black soil of illinoisthe painted
desert the home of the sage brush and the coyote the level prairies of
iowathe mighty rockies shouldering themselves high against the
horizon the long bleak winters of wisconsincalifornia of endless
summer the log churches of indiana or illinoisthe quaint missions of
san antonio tucson and santa barbara the little state of

and scattered about through the southwest were signs of an ancient
civilizationfragments of fourand fivestory dwellings ruined dams
aqueducts and broken canals which told of once prosperous peoples
who by art and science had conquered the aridity of the desert and
lifted themselves in the scale of culture above the savages of the
plain

the settlers of this vast empire were to be as diverse in their origins
and habits as those of the colonies on the coast had been americans of
english irish and scotchirish descent came as usual from the eastern
states to them were added the migratory germans as well now for the
first time came throngs of scandinavians some were to make their homes
on quiet farms as the border advanced against the setting sun others
were to be indian scouts trappers fur hunters miners cowboys texas
planters keepers of lonely posts on the plain and the desert stage
drivers pilots of wagon trains pony riders fruit growers lumber
jacks and smelter workers one common bond united thema passion for
the selfgovernment accorded to states as soon as a few thousand
settlers came together in a single territory there arose a mighty shout
for a position beside the staid commonwealths of the east and the south
statehood meant to the pioneers selfgovernment dignity and the right
to dispose of land minerals and timber in their own way in the quest
for this local autonomy there arose many a wordy contest in congress
each of the political parties lending a helping hand in the admission of
a state when it gave promise of adding new congressmen of the right
political persuasion to use the current phrase

southern planters and texaswhile the farmers of the north found the
broad acres of the western prairies stretching on before them apparently
in endless expanse it was far different with the southern planters
ever active in their search for new fields as they exhausted the virgin
soil of the older states the restless subjects of king cotton quickly
reached the frontier of louisiana there they paused but only for a
moment the fertile land of texas just across the boundary lured them on
and the mexican republic to which it belonged extended to them a more
than generous welcome little realizing the perils lurking in a
peaceful penetration the authorities at mexico city opened wide the
doors and made large grants of land to american contractors who agreed
to bring a number of families into texas the omnipresent yankee in the
person of moses austin of connecticut hearing of this good news in the
southwest obtained a grant in  to settle three hundred americans
near bexara commission finally carried out to the letter by his son
and celebrated in the name given to the present capital of the state of
texas within a decade some twenty thousand americans had crossed the
border

mexico closes the doorthe government of mexico unaccustomed to
such enterprise and thoroughly frightened by its extent drew back in
dismay its fears were increased as quarrels broke out between the
americans and the natives in texas fear grew into consternation when
efforts were made by president jackson to buy the territory for the
united states mexico then sought to close the flood gates it stopped
all american colonization schemes canceled many of the land grants put
a tariff on farming implements and abolished slavery these barriers
were raised too late a call for help ran through the western border of
the united states the sentinels of the frontier answered davy
crockett the noted frontiersman bear hunter and backwoods politician
james bowie the dexterous wielder of the knife that to this day bears
his name and sam houston warrior and pioneer rushed to the aid of
their countrymen in texas unacquainted with the niceties of diplomacy
impatient at the formalities of international law they soon made it
known that in spite of mexican sovereignty they would be their own
masters

the independence of texas declarednumbering only about onefourth
of the population in texas they raised the standard of revolt in 
and summoned a convention following in the footsteps of their
ancestors they issued a declaration of independence signed mainly by
americans from the slave states anticipating that the government of
mexico would not quietly accept their word of defiance as final they
dispatched a force to repel the invading army as general houston
called the troops advancing under the command of santa ana the mexican
president a portion of the texan soldiers took their stand in the
alamo an old spanish mission in the cottonwood trees in the town of san
antonio instead of obeying the order to blow up the mission and retire
they held their ground until they were completely surrounded and cut off
from all help refusing to surrender they fought to the bitter end the
last man falling a victim to the sword vengeance was swift within
three months general houston overwhelmed santa ana at the san jacinto
taking him prisoner of war and putting an end to all hopes for the
restoration of mexican sovereignty over texas

the lone star republic with houston at the head then sought admission
to the united states this seemed at first an easy matter all that was
required to bring it about appeared to be a treaty annexing texas to the
union moreover president jackson at the height of his popularity had
a warm regard for general houston and with his usual sympathy for rough
and ready ways of doing things approved the transaction through an
american representative in mexico jackson had long and anxiously
labored by means none too nice to wring from the mexican republic the
cession of the coveted territory when the texans took matters into
their own hands he was more than pleased but he could not marshal the
approval of twothirds of the senators required for a treaty of
annexation cautious as well as impetuous jackson did not press the
issue he went out of office in  with texas uncertain as to her
future

northern opposition to annexationall through the north the
opposition to annexation was clear and strong antislavery agitators
could hardly find words savage enough to express their feelings
texas exclaimed channing in a letter to clay is but the first step
of aggression i trust indeed that providence will beat back and humble
our cupidity and ambition i now ask whether as a people we are
prepared to seize on a neighboring territory for the end of extending
slavery i ask whether as a people we can stand forth in the sight of
god in the sight of nations and adopt this atrocious policy sooner
perish sooner be our name blotted out from the record of nations
william lloyd garrison called for the secession of the northern states
if texas was brought into the union with slavery john quincy adams
warned his countrymen that they were treading in the path of the
imperialism that had brought the nations of antiquity to judgment and
destruction henry clay the whig candidate for president taking into
account changing public sentiment blew hot and cold losing the state
of new york and the election of  by giving a qualified approval of
annexation in the same campaign the democrats boldly demanded the
reannexation of texas based on claims which the united states once
had to spanish territory beyond the sabine river

annexationthe politicians were disposed to walk very warily van
buren at heart opposed to slavery extension refused to press the issue
of annexation tyler a proslavery democrat from virginia by a strange
fling of fortune carried into office as a nominal whig kept his mind
firmly fixed on the idea of reelection and let the troublesome matter
rest until the end of his administration was in sight he then listened
with favor to the voice of the south calhoun stated what seemed to be a
convincing argument all good americans have their hearts set on the
constitution the admission of texas is absolutely essential to the
preservation of the union it will give a balance of power to the south
as against the north growing with incredible swiftness in wealth and
population tyler impressed by the plea appointed calhoun to the
office of secretary of state in  authorizing him to negotiate the
treaty of annexationa commission at once executed this scheme was
blocked in the senate where the necessary twothirds vote could not be
secured balked but not defeated the advocates of annexation drew up a
joint resolution which required only a majority vote in both houses
and in february of the next year just before tyler gave way to polk
they pushed it through congress so texas amid the groans of boston and
the hurrahs of charleston folded up her flag and came into the union

illustration texas and the territory in dispute

the mexican warthe inevitable war with mexico foretold by the
abolitionists and feared by henry clay ensued the ostensible cause
being a dispute over the boundaries of the new state the texans claimed
all the lands down to the rio grande the mexicans placed the border of
texas at the nueces river and a line drawn thence in a northerly
direction president polk accepting the texan view of the controversy
ordered general zachary taylor to move beyond the nueces in defense of
american sovereignty this act of power deemed by the mexicans an
invasion of their territory was followed by an attack on our troops

president polk not displeased with the turn of events announced that
american blood had been spilled on american soil and that war existed
by the act of mexico congress in a burst of patriotic fervor
brushed aside the protests of those who deplored the conduct of the
government as wanton aggression on a weaker nation and granted money and
supplies to prosecute the war the few whigs in the house of
representatives who refused to vote in favor of taking up arms
accepted the inevitable with such good grace as they could command all
through the south and the west the war was popular new england
grumbled but gave loyal if not enthusiastic support to a conflict
precipitated by policies not of its own choosing only a handful of firm
objectors held out james russell lowell in his biglow papers flung
scorn and sarcasm to the bitter end

the outcome of the warthe foregone conclusion was soon reached
general taylor might have delivered the fatal thrust from northern
mexico if politics had not intervened polk anxious to avoid raising up
another military hero for the whigs to nominate for president decided
to divide the honors by sending general scott to strike a blow at the
capital mexico city the deed was done with speed and pomp and two
heroes were lifted into presidential possibilities in the far west a
third candidate was made john c fremont who in cooperation with
commodores sloat and stockton and general kearney planted the stars and
stripes on the pacific slope

in february  the mexicans came to terms ceding to the victor
california arizona new mexico and morea domain greater in extent
than the combined areas of france and germany as a salve to the wound
the vanquished received fifteen million dollars in cash and the
cancellation of many claims held by american citizens five years later
through the negotiations of james gadsden a further cession of lands
along the southern border of arizona and new mexico was secured on
payment of ten million dollars

general taylor elected presidentthe ink was hardly dry upon the
treaty that closed the war before rough and ready general taylor a
slave owner from louisiana a whig as he said but not an ultra
whig was put forward as the whig candidate for president he himself
had not voted for years and he was fairly innocent in matters political
the tariff the currency and internal improvements with a magnificent
gesture he referred to the peoples representatives in congress
offering to enforce the laws as made if elected clays followers
mourned polk stormed but could not win even a renomination at the hands
of the democrats so it came about that the hero of buena vista
celebrated for his laconic order give em a little more grape captain
bragg became president of the united states


the pacific coast and utah

oregonclosely associated in the popular mind with the contest about
the affairs of texas was a dispute with great britain over the
possession of territory in oregon in their presidential campaign of
 the democrats had coupled with the slogan the reannexation of
texas two other cries the reoccupation of oregon and fiftyfour
forty or fight the last two slogans were founded on american
discoveries and explorations in the far northwest their appearance in
politics showed that the distant oregon country larger in area than new
england new york and pennsylvania combined was at last receiving from
the nation the attention which its importance warranted

joint occupation and settlementboth england and the united states
had long laid claim to oregon and in  they had agreed to occupy the
territory jointlya contract which was renewed ten years later for an
indefinite period under this plan citizens of both countries were free
to hunt and settle anywhere in the region the vanguard of british fur
traders and canadian priests was enlarged by many new recruits with
americans not far behind them john jacob astor the resourceful new

through news from the fur traders and missionaries eastern farmers
heard of the fertile lands awaiting their plows on the pacific slope
those with the pioneering spirit made ready to take possession of the
new country in  a band went around by cape horn four years later a
great expedition went overland the way once broken others followed
rapidly as soon as a few settlements were well established the
pioneers held a mass meeting and agreed upon a plan of government we
the people of oregon territory runs the preamble to their compact
for the purposes of mutual protection and to secure peace and
prosperity among ourselves agree to adopt the following laws and
regulations until such time as the united states of america extend their
jurisdiction over us thus selfgovernment made its way across the
rocky mountains

illustration the oregon country and the disputed boundary

the boundary dispute with england adjustedby this time it was
evident that the boundaries of oregon must be fixed having made the
question an issue in his campaign polk after his election in 
pressed it upon the attention of the country in his inaugural address
and his first message to congress he reiterated the claim of the
democratic platform that our title to the whole territory of oregon is
clear and unquestionable this pretension great britain firmly
rejected leaving the president a choice between war and compromise

polk already having the contest with mexico on his hands sought and
obtained a compromise the british government moved by a hint from the
american minister offered a settlement which would fix the boundary at
the fortyninth parallel instead of fiftyfour forty and give it
vancouver island polk speedily chose this way out of the dilemma
instead of making the decision himself however and drawing up a
treaty he turned to the senate for counsel as prearranged with party
leaders the advice was favorable to the plan the treaty duly drawn in
 was ratified by the senate after an acrimonious debate oh
mountain that was delivered of a mouse exclaimed senator benton thy
name shall be fiftyfour forty thirteen years later the southern part
of the territory was admitted to the union as the state of oregon
leaving the northern and eastern sections in the status of a territory

californiawith the growth of the northwestern empire dedicated by
nature to freedom the planting interests might have been content had
fortune not wrested from them the fair country of california upon this
huge territory they had set their hearts the mild climate and fertile
soil seemed well suited to slavery and the planters expected to extend
their sway to the entire domain california was a state of more than
 square milesabout seventy times the size of the state of
delaware it could readily be divided into five or six large states if
that became necessary to preserve the southern balance of power

early american relations with californiatime and tide it seems
were not on the side of the planters already americans of a far
different type were invading the pacific slope long before polk ever
dreamed of california the yankee with his cargo of notions had been
around the horn daring skippers had sailed out of new england harbors
with a variety of goods bent their course around south america to
california on to china and around the world trading as they went and
leaving pots pans woolen cloth guns boots shoes salt fish naval
stores and rum in their wake home from californy rang the cry in
many a new england port as a good captain let go his anchor on his
return from the long trading voyage in the pacific

western scouts searched for overland routes to the pacific zebulon
pike explorer and pathfinder by his expedition into the southwest
during jeffersons administration had discovered the resources of new
spain and had shown his countrymen how easy it was to reach santa fe
from the upper waters of the arkansas river not long afterward traders
laid open the route making franklin missouri and later fort
leavenworth the starting point along the trail once surveyed poured
caravans heavily guarded by armed men against marauding indians sand
storms often wiped out all signs of the route hunger and thirst did
many a band of wagoners to death but the lure of the game and the
profits at the end kept the business thriving huge stocks of cottons
glass hardware and ammunition were drawn almost across the continent
to be exchanged at santa fe for furs indian blankets silver and
mules and many a fortune was made out of the traffic

secured by the friends of free soil there came in  the sudden
discovery of gold at sutters mill in the sacramento valley when this

naturally resulted the usual demand for admission to the union instead
of waiting for authority from washington the californians held a
convention in  and framed their constitution with impatience the
delegates brushed aside the plea that the balance of power between the
north and south required the admission of their state as a slave
commonwealth without a dissenting voice they voted in favor of freedom
and boldly made their request for inclusion among the united states

utahon the long road to california in the midst of forbidding and
barren wastes a religious sect the mormons had planted a colony
destined to a stormy career founded in  under the leadership of
joseph smith of new york the sect had suffered from many cruel buffets
of fortune from ohio they had migrated into missouri where they were
set upon and beaten some of them were murdered by indignant neighbors
harried out of missouri they went into illinois only to see their
director and prophet smith first imprisoned by the authorities and
then shot by a mob having raised up a cloud of enemies on account of
both their religious faith and their practice of allowing a man to have
more than one wife they fell in heartily with the suggestion of a new
leader brigham young that they go into the far west beyond the plains
of kansasinto the forlorn desert where the wicked would cease from
troubling and the weary could be at rest as they read in the bible in
 young with a company of picked men searched far and wide until
he found a suitable spot overlooking the salt lake valley returning to
illinois he gathered up his followers now numbering several thousand
and in one mighty wagon caravan they all went to their distant haven

brigham young and his economic systemin brigham young the mormons
had a leader of remarkable power who gave direction to the redemption of
the arid soil the management of property and the upbuilding of
industry he promised them to make the desert blossom as the rose and
verily he did it he firmly shaped the enterprise of the colony along
cooperative lines holding down the speculator and profiteer with one
hand and giving encouragement to the industrious poor with the other
with the shrewdness befitting a good business man he knew how to draw
the line between public and private interest land was given outright to
each family but great care was exercised in the distribution so that
none should have great advantage over another the purchase of supplies
and the sale of produce were carried on through a cooperative store the
profits of which went to the common good encountering for the first
time in the history of the anglosaxon race the problem of aridity the
mormons surmounted the most perplexing obstacles with astounding skill
they built irrigation works by cooperative labor and granted water
rights to all families on equitable terms

the growth of industriesthough farming long remained the major
interest of the colony the mormons eager to be selfsupporting in
every possible way bent their efforts also to manufacturing and later
to mining their missionaries who hunted in the highways and byways of
europe for converts never failed to stress the economic advantages of
the sect we want proclaimed president young to all the earth a
company of woolen manufacturers to come with machinery and take the wool
from the sheep and convert it into the best clothes we want a company
of potters we need them the clay is ready and the dishes wanted we
want some men to start a furnace forthwith the iron coal and molders
are waiting we have a printing press and any one who can take good
printing and writing paper to the valley will be a blessing to
themselves and the church roads and bridges were built millions were
spent in experiments in agriculture and manufacturing missionaries at a
huge cost were maintained in the east and in europe an army was kept
for defense against the indians and colonies were planted in the
outlying regions a historian of deseret as the colony was called by
the mormons estimated in  that by the labor of their hands the
people had produced nearly half a billion dollars in wealth since the
coming of the vanguard

polygamy forbiddenthe hope of the mormons that they might forever
remain undisturbed by outsiders was soon dashed to earth for hundreds
of farmers and artisans belonging to other religious sects came to
settle among them in  the colony was so populous and prosperous
that it was organized into a territory of the united states and brought
under the supervision of the federal government protests against
polygamy were raised in the colony and at the seat of authority three
thousand miles away at washington the new republican party in 
proclaimed it the right and duty of congress to prohibit in the
territories those twin relics of barbarism polygamy and slavery in
due time the mormons had to give up their marriage practices which were
condemned by the common opinion of all western civilization but they
kept their religious faith monuments to their early enterprise are seen
in the temple and the tabernacle the irrigation works and the great
wealth of the church


summary of western development and national politics

while the statesmen of the old generation were solving the problems of
their age hunters pioneers and home seekers were preparing new
problems beyond the alleghanies the west was rising in population and
wealth between  and  eleven states were added to the original
thirteen all but two were in the west two of them were in the
louisiana territory beyond the mississippi here the process of
colonization was repeated hardy frontier people cut down the forests
built log cabins laid out farms and cut roads through the wilderness
they began a new civilization just as the immigrants to virginia or
massachusetts had done two centuries earlier

like the seaboard colonists before them they too cherished the spirit
of independence and power they had not gone far upon their course
before they resented the monopoly of the presidency by the east in 
they actually sent one of their own cherished leaders andrew jackson
to the white house again in  in  in  and in  the
mississippi valley could boast that one of its sons had been chosen for
the seat of power at washington its democratic temper evoked a cordial
response in the towns of the east where the old aristocracy had been put
aside and artisans had been given the ballot

for three decades the west occupied the interest of the nation under
jacksons leadership it destroyed the second united states bank when
he smote nullification in south carolina it gave him cordial support
it approved his policy of parceling out government offices among party
workersthe spoils system in all its fullness on only one point did
it really dissent the west heartily favored internal improvements the
appropriation of federal funds for highways canals and railways
jackson had misgivings on this question and awakened sharp criticism by
vetoing a road improvement bill

from their point of vantage on the frontier the pioneers pressed on
westward they pushed into texas created a state declared their
independence demanded a place in the union and precipitated a war with
mexico they crossed the trackless plain and desert laying out trails
to santa fe to oregon and to california they were upon the scene when
the mexican war brought california under the stars and stripes they had
laid out their farms in the willamette valley when the slogan
fiftyfour forty or fight forced a settlement of the oregon boundary
california and oregon were already in the union when there arose the
great civil war testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated could long endure

chapter xiii

the rise of the industrial system


if jefferson could have lived to see the stars and stripes planted on
the pacific coast the broad empire of texas added to the planting
states and the valley of the willamette waving with wheat sown by
farmers from new england he would have been more than fortified in his
faith that the future of america lay in agriculture even a stanch old
federalist like gouverneur morris or josiah quincy would have mournfully
conceded both the prophecy and the claim manifest destiny never seemed
more clearly written in the stars

as the farmers from the northwest and planters from the southwest poured
in upon the floor of congress the party of jefferson christened anew
by jackson grew stronger year by year opponents there were no doubt
disgruntled critics and whigs by conviction but in  franklin
pierce the democratic candidate for president carried every state in
the union except massachusetts vermont kentucky and tennessee this
victory a triumph under ordinary circumstances was all the more
significant in that pierce was pitted against a hero of the mexican war
general scott whom the whigs hoping to win by rousing the martial
ardor of the voters had nominated on looking at the election returns
the new president calmly assured the planters that the general
principle of reduction of duties with a view to revenue may now be
regarded as the settled policy of the country with equal confidence
he waved aside those agitators who devoted themselves to the supposed
interests of the relatively few africans in the united states like a
watchman in the night he called to the country alls well

the party of hamilton and clay lay in the dust


the industrial revolution

as pride often goeth before a fall so sanguine expectation is sometimes
the symbol of defeat jackson destroyed the bank polk signed the tariff
bill of  striking an effective blow at the principle of protection
for manufactures pierce promised to silence the abolitionists his
successor was to approve a drastic step in the direction of free trade
nevertheless all these things left untouched the springs of power that
were in due time to make america the greatest industrial nation on the
earth namely vast national resources business enterprise inventive
genius and the free labor supply of europe unseen by the thoughtless
unrecorded in the diaries of wiseacres rarely mentioned in the speeches
of statesmen there was swiftly rising such a tide in the affairs of
america as jefferson and hamilton never dreamed of in their little
philosophies

industry outstrips plantingthe story of invention that tribute to
the triumph of mind over matter fascinating as a romance need not be
treated in detail here the effects of invention on social and political
life multitudinous and neverending form the very warp and woof of
american progress from the days of andrew jackson to the latest hour
neither the great civil conflictthe clash of two systemsnor the
problems of the modern age can be approached without an understanding of
the striking phases of industrialism

illustration a new england mill built in 

first and foremost among them was the uprush of mills managed by
captains of industry and manned by labor drawn from farms cities and
foreign lands for every planter who cleared a domain in the southwest
and gathered his army of bondmen about him there rose in the north a
magician of steam and steel who collected under his roof an army of free
workers

in seven league boots this new giant strode ahead of the southern giant
between  and  to use dollars and cents as the measure of
progress the value of domestic manufactures including mines and
fisheries rose from  to  an increase of
eightysix per cent in ten years in this same period the total
production of naval stores rice sugar tobacco and cotton the
staples of the south went only from  in round figures to
 at the halfway point of the century the capital invested
in industry commerce and cities far exceeded the value of all the farm
land between the atlantic and the pacific thus the course of economy
had been reversed in fifty years tested by figures of production king
cotton had shriveled by  to a petty prince in comparison for each
year the captains of industry turned out goods worth nearly twenty times
all the bales of cotton picked on southern plantations iron boots and
shoes and leather goods pouring from northern mills surpassed in value
the entire cotton output

the agrarian west turns to industrynor was this vast enterprise
confined to the old northeast where as madison had sagely remarked
commerce was early dominant cincinnati runs an official report in
 appears to be a great central depot for readymade clothing and
its manufacture for the western markets may be said to be one of the
great trades of that city there wrote another traveler i heard the
crack of the cattle drivers whip and the hum of the factory the west
and the east meeting louisville and st louis were already famous for
their clothing trades and the manufacture of cotton bagging five
hundred of the two thousand woolen mills in the country in  were in
the western states of the output of flour and grist mills which almost
reached in value the cotton crop of  the ohio valley furnished a
rapidly growing share the old home of jacksonian democracy where
federalists had been almost as scarce as monarchists turned slowly
backward as the needle to the pole toward the principle of protection
for domestic industry espoused by hamilton and defended by clay

the extension of canals and railwaysas necessary to mechanical
industry as steel and steam power was the great market spread over a
wide and diversified area and knit together by efficient means of
transportation this service was supplied to industry by the steamship
which began its career on the hudson in  by the canals of which
the erie opened in  was the most noteworthy and by the railways
which came into practical operation about 

illustration from an old print

an early railway

with sure instinct the eastern manufacturer reached out for the markets
of the northwest territory where free farmers were producing annually
staggering crops of corn wheat bacon and wool the two great canal
systemsthe erie connecting new york city with the waterways of the
great lakes and the pennsylvania chain linking philadelphia with the
headwaters of the ohiogradually turned the tide of trade from new
orleans to the eastern seaboard the railways followed the same paths
by  new york had rail connections with chicago and st louis one
of the routes running through the hudson and mohawk valleys and along
the great lakes the other through philadelphia and pennsylvania and
across the rich wheat fields of ohio indiana and illinois baltimore
not to be outdone by her two rivals reached out over the mountains for
the western trade and in  had trains running into st louis

in railway enterprise the south took more interest than in canals and
the friends of that section came to its aid to offset the magnet
drawing trade away from the mississippi valley lines were built from
the gulf to chicago the illinois central part of the project being a
monument to the zeal and industry of a democrat better known in
politics than in business stephen a douglas the swift movement of
cotton and tobacco to the north or to seaports was of common concern to
planters and manufacturers accordingly lines were flung down along the
southern coast linking richmond charleston and savannah with the
northern markets other lines struck inland from the coast giving a
rail outlet to the sea for raleigh columbia atlanta chattanooga
nashville and montgomery nevertheless in spite of this enterprise
the mileage of all the southern states in  did not equal that of
ohio indiana and illinois combined

banking and financeout of commerce and manufactures and the
construction and operation of railways came such an accumulation of
capital in the northern states as merchants of old never imagined the
banks of the four industrial states of massachusetts connecticut new
york and pennsylvania in  had funds greater than the banks in all
the other states combined new york city had become the money market of
america the center to which industrial companies railway promoters
farmers and planters turned for capital to initiate and carry on their
operations the banks of louisiana south carolina georgia and
virginia it is true had capital far in excess of the banks of the
northwest but still they were relatively small compared with the
financial institutions of the east

the growth of the industrial populationa revolution of such
magnitude in industry transport and finance overturning as it did the
agrarian civilization of the old northwest and reaching out to the very
borders of the country could not fail to bring in its train
consequences of a striking character some were immediate and obvious
others require a fullness of time not yet reached to reveal their
complete significance outstanding among them was the growth of an
industrial population detached from the land concentrated in cities
and to use jeffersons phrase dependent upon the caprices and
casualties of trade for a livelihood this was a result as the great
virginian had foreseen which flowed inevitably from public and private
efforts to stimulate industry as against agriculture

illustration lowell massachusetts in  an early industrial
town

it was estimated in  on the basis of the census figures that
mechanical production gave employment to  men and 
women making if the average number of dependents upon them be
reckoned nearly six million people or about onesixth of the population
of the country sustained from manufactures this runs the official
record was exclusive of the number engaged in the production of many
of the raw materials and of the food for manufacturers in the
distribution of their products such as merchants clerks draymen
mariners the employees of railroads expresses and steamboats of
capitalists various artistic and professional classes as well as
carpenters bricklayers painters and the members of other mechanical
trades not classed as manufactures it is safe to assume then that
onethird of the whole population is supported directly or indirectly
by manufacturing industry taking however the number of persons
directly supported by manufactures namely about six millions reveals
the astounding fact that the white laboring population divorced from
the soil already exceeded the number of slaves on southern farms and
plantations

immigrationthe more carefully the rapid growth of the industrial
population is examined the more surprising is the fact that such an
immense body of free laborers could be found particularly when it is
recalled to what desperate straits the colonial leaders were put in
securing immigrantsslavery indentured servitude and kidnapping
being the fruits of their necessities the answer to the enigma is to be
found partly in european conditions and partly in the cheapness of
transportation after the opening of the era of steam navigation shrewd
observers of the course of events had long foreseen that a flood of
cheap labor was bound to come when the way was made easy some among
them chief justice ellsworth went so far as to prophesy that white
labor would in time be so abundant that slavery would disappear as the
more costly of the two labor systems the processes of nature were aided
by the policies of government in england and germany

the coming of the irishthe opposition of the irish people to the
english government ever furious and irrepressible was increased in the
mid forties by an almost total failure of the potato crop the main
support of the peasants catholic in religion they had been compelled
to support a protestant church tillers of the soil by necessity they
were forced to pay enormous tributes to absentee landlords in england
whose claim to their estates rested upon the title of conquest and
confiscation intensely loyal to their race the irish were subjected in
all things to the parliament at london in which their small minority of
representatives had little influence save in holding a balance of power
between the two contending english parties to the constant political
irritation the potato famine added physical distress beyond
description in cottages and fields and along the highways the victims
of starvation lay dead by the hundreds the relief which charity
afforded only bringing misery more sharply to the foreground those who
were fortunate enough to secure passage money sought escape to america
in  the total immigration into the united states was less than
eighty thousand in  it had risen by leaps and bounds to more than
three hundred thousand between  and  the immigrants from the
united kingdom numbered  of whom more than onehalf were
irish it has been said with a touch of exaggeration that the american
canals and railways of those days were built by the labor of irishmen

the german migrationto political discontent and economic distress
such as was responsible for the coming of the irish may likewise be
traced the source of the germanic migration the potato blight that fell
upon ireland visited the rhine valley and southern germany at the same
time with results as pitiful if less extensive the calamity inflicted
by nature was followed shortly by another inflicted by the despotic
conduct of german kings and princes in  there had occurred
throughout europe a popular uprising in behalf of republics and
democratic government for a time it rode on a full tide of success
kings were overthrown or compelled to promise constitutional
government and tyrannical ministers fled from their palaces then came
reaction those who had championed the popular cause were imprisoned
shot or driven out of the land men of attainments and distinction
whose sole offense was opposition to the government of kings and
princes sought an asylum in america carrying with them to the land of
their adoption the spirit of liberty and democracy in  over fifty
thousand germans came to america the forerunners of a migration that
increased almost steadily for many years the record of  showed
that in the previous twenty years nearly a million and a half had found
homes in the united states far and wide they scattered from the mills
and shops of the seacoast towns to the uttermost frontiers of wisconsin
and minnesota

the labor of women and childrenif the industries canals and
railways of the country were largely manned by foreign labor still
important native sources must not be overlooked above all the women
and children of the new england textile districts spinning and weaving
by a tradition that runs far beyond the written records of mankind
belonged to women indeed it was the dexterous housewives spinsters
and boys and girls that laid the foundations of the textile industry in
america foundations upon which the mechanical revolution was built as
the wheel and loom were taken out of the homes to the factories operated
by water power or the steam engine the women and to use hamiltons
phrase the children of tender years followed as a matter of course
the cotton manufacture alone employs six thousand persons in lowell
wrote a french observer in  of this number nearly five thousand
are young women from seventeen to twentyfour years of age the
daughters of farmers from the different new england states it was not
until after the middle of the century that foreign lands proved to be
the chief source from which workers were recruited for the factories of
new england it was then that the daughters of the puritans outdone by
the competition of foreign labor both of men and women left the
spinning jenny and the loom to other hands

the rise of organized laborthe changing conditions of american
life marked by the spreading mill towns of new england new york and
pennsylvania and the growth of cities like buffalo cincinnati
louisville st louis detroit and chicago in the west naturally
brought changes as jefferson had prophesied in manners and morals a
few mechanics smiths carpenters and masons widely scattered through
farming regions and rural villages raise no such problems as tens of
thousands of workers collected in one center in daily intercourse
learning the power of cooperation and union

even before the coming of steam and machinery in the good old days of
handicrafts laborers in many tradesprinters shoemakers carpenters
for examplehad begun to draw together in the towns for the advancement
of their interests in the form of higher wages shorter days and
milder laws the shoemakers of philadelphia organized in 
conducted a strike in  and held together until indicted seven years
later for conspiracy during the twenties and thirties local labor
unions sprang up in all industrial centers and they led almost
immediately to city federations of the several crafts

as the thousands who were dependent upon their daily labor for their
livelihood mounted into the millions and industries spread across the
continent the local unions of craftsmen grew into national craft
organizations bound together by the newspapers the telegraph and the
railways before  there were several such national trade unions
including the plumbers printers mule spinners iron molders and stone
cutters all over the north labor leaders arosemen unknown to general
history but forceful and resourceful characters who forged links binding
scattered and individual workers into a common brotherhood an attempt
was even made in  to federate all the crafts into a permanent
national organization but it perished within three years through lack
of support half a century had to elapse before the american federation
of labor was to accomplish this task

all the manifestations of the modern labor movement had appeared in
germ at least by the time the midcentury was reached unions labor
leaders strikes a labor press a labor political program and a labor
political party in every great city industrial disputes were a common
occurrence the papers recorded about four hundred in two years
 local affairs but forecasting economic struggles in a larger
field the labor press seems to have begun with the founding of the
mechanics free press in philadelphia in  and the establishment of
the new york workingmans advocate shortly afterward these
semipolitical papers were in later years followed by regular trade
papers designed to weld together and advance the interests of particular
crafts edited by able leaders these little sheets with limited
circulation wielded an enormous influence in the ranks of the workers

labor and politicsas for the political program of labor the main
planks were clear and specific the abolition of imprisonment for debt
manhood suffrage in states where property qualifications still
prevailed free and universal education laws protecting the safety and
health of workers in mills and factories abolition of lotteries repeal
of laws requiring militia service and free land in the west

into the labor papers and platforms there sometimes crept a note of
hostility to the masters of industry a sign of bitterness that excited
little alarm while cheap land in the west was open to the discontented
the philadelphia workmen in issuing a call for a local convention
invited all those of our fellow citizens who live by their own labor
and none other in newcastle county delaware the association of
working people complained in  the poor have no laws the laws are
made by the rich and of course for the rich here and there an
extremist went to the length of advocating an equal division of wealth
among all the peoplethe crudest kind of communism

agitation of this character produced in labor circles profound distrust
of both whigs and democrats who talked principally about tariffs and
banks it resulted in attempts to found independent labor parties in
philadelphia albany new york city and new england labor candidates
were put up for elections in the early thirties and in a few cases were
victorious at the polls the balance of power has at length got into
the hands of the working people where it properly belongs
triumphantly exclaimed the mechanics free press of philadelphia in
 but the triumph was illusory dissensions appeared in the labor
ranks the old party leaders particularly of tammany hall the
democratic party organization in new york city offered concessions to
labor in return for votes newspapers unsparingly denounced trade union
politicians as demagogues levellers and rag tag and bobtail
and some of them deeming labor unrest the sour fruit of manhood
suffrage suggested disfranchisement as a remedy under the influence
of concessions and attacks the political fever quickly died away and
the end of the decade left no remnant of the labor political parties
labor leaders turned to a task which seemed more substantial and
practical that of organizing workingmen into craft unions for the
definite purpose of raising wages and reducing hours


the industrial revolution and national politics

southern plans for union with the westit was long the design of
southern statesmen like calhoun to hold the west and the south together
in one political party the theory on which they based their hope was
simple both sections were agriculturalthe producers of raw materials
and the buyers of manufactured goods the planters were heavy purchasers
of western bacon pork mules and grain the mississippi river and its
tributaries formed the natural channel for the transportation of heavy
produce southward to the plantations and outward to europe therefore
ran their political reasoning the interests of the two sections were
one by standing together in favor of low tariffs they could buy their
manufactures cheaply in europe and pay for them in cotton tobacco and
grain the union of the two sections under jacksons management seemed
perfect

the east forms ties with the westeastern leaders were not blind to
the ambitions of southern statesmen on the contrary they also
recognized the importance of forming strong ties with the agrarian west
and drawing the produce of the ohio valley to philadelphia and new york
the canals and railways were the physical signs of this economic union
and the results commercial and political were soon evident by the
middle of the century southern economists noted the change one of
them de bow lamenting that the great cities of the north have
severally penetrated the interior with artificial lines until they have
taken from the open and untaxed current of the mississippi the commerce
produced on its borders to this writer it was an astounding thing to
behold the number of steamers that now descend the upper mississippi
river loaded to the guards with produce as far as the mouth of the
illinois river and then turn up that stream with their cargoes to be
shipped to new york via chicago the illinois canal has not only swept
the whole produce along the line of the illinois river to the east but
it is drawing the products of the upper mississippi through the same
channel thus depriving new orleans and st louis of a rich portion of
their former trade

if to any shippers the broad current of the great river sweeping down to
new orleans offered easier means of physical communication to the sea
than the canals and railways the difference could be overcome by the
credit which eastern bankers were able to extend to the grain and
produce buyers in the first instance and through them to the farmers
on the soil the acute southern observer just quoted de bow admitted
with evident regret in  that last autumn the rich regions of
ohio indiana and illinois were flooded with the local bank notes of
the eastern states advanced by the new york houses on produce to be
shipped by way of the canals in the spring these moneyed facilities
enable the packer miller and speculator to hold on to their produce
until the opening of navigation in the spring and they are no longer
obliged as formerly to hurry off their shipments during the winter by
the way of new orleans in order to realize funds by drafts on their
shipments the banking facilities at the east are doing as much to draw
trade from us as the canals and railways which eastern capital is
constructing thus canals railways and financial credit were swiftly
forging bonds of union between the old home of jacksonian democracy in
the west and the older home of federalism in the east the nationalism
to which webster paid eloquent tribute became more and more real with
the passing of time the selfsufficiency of the pioneer was broken down
as he began to watch the produce markets of new york and philadelphia
where the prices of corn and hogs fixed his earnings for the year

the west and manufacturesin addition to the commercial bonds
between the east and the west there was growing up a common interest in
manufactures as skilled white labor increased in the ohio valley the
industries springing up in the new cities made western life more like
that of the industrial east than like that of the planting south
moreover the western states produced some important raw materials for
american factories which called for protection against foreign
competition notably wool hemp and flax as the south had little or
no foreign competition in cotton and tobacco the east could not offer
protection for her raw materials in exchange for protection for
industries with the west however it became possible to establish
reciprocity in tariffs that is for example to trade a high rate on
wool for a high rate on textiles or iron

the south dependent on the northwhile east and west were drawing
together the distinctions between north and south were becoming more
marked the latter having few industries and producing little save raw
materials was being forced into the position of a dependent section as
a result of the protective tariff southern planters were compelled to
turn more and more to northern mills for their cloth shoes hats hoes
plows and machinery nearly all the goods which they bought in europe
in exchange for their produce came overseas to northern ports whence
transshipments were made by rail and water to southern points of
distribution their rice cotton and tobacco in as far as they were
not carried to europe in british bottoms were transported by northern
masters in these ways a large part of the financial operations
connected with the sale of southern produce and the purchase of goods in
exchange passed into the hands of northern merchants and bankers who
naturally made profits from their transactions finally southern
planters who wanted to buy more land and more slaves on credit borrowed
heavily in the north where huge accumulations made the rates of interest
lower than the smaller banks of the south could afford

the south reckons the cost of economic dependenceas southern
dependence upon northern capital became more and more marked southern
leaders began to chafe at what they regarded as restraints laid upon
their enterprise in a word they came to look upon the planter as a
tributebearer to the manufacturer and financier the south
expostulated de bow stands in the attitude of feeding  a vast
population of northern merchants shipowners capitalists and others
who without claims on her progeny drink up the life blood of her
trade where goes the value of our labor but to those who taking
advantage of our folly ship for us buy for us sell to us and after
turning our own capital to their profitable account return laden with
our money to enjoy their easily earned opulence at home

southern statisticians not satisfied with generalities attempted to
figure out how great was this tribute in dollars and cents they
estimated that the planters annually lent to northern merchants the full
value of their exports a hundred millions or more to be used in the
manipulation of foreign imports they calculated that no less than
forty millions all told had been paid to shipowners in profits they
reckoned that if the south were to work up her own cotton she would
realize from seventy to one hundred millions a year that otherwise went
north finally to cap the climax they regretted that planters spent
some fifteen millions a year pleasureseeking in the alluring cities and
summer resorts of the north

southern opposition to northern policiesproceeding from these
premises southern leaders drew the logical conclusion that the entire
program of economic measures demanded in the north was without exception
adverse to southern interests and by a similar chain of reasoning
injurious to the corn and wheat producers of the west cheap labor
afforded by free immigration a protective tariff raising prices of
manufactures for the tiller of the soil ship subsidies increasing the
tonnage of carrying trade in northern hands internal improvements
forging new economic bonds between the east and the west a national
banking system giving strict national control over the currency as a
safeguard against paper inflationall these devices were regarded in
the south as contrary to the planting interest they were constantly
compared with the restrictive measures by which great britain more than
half a century before had sought to bind american interests

as oppression justified a war for independence once statesmen argued
so it can justify it again it is curious as it is melancholy and
distressing came a broad hint from south carolina to see how
striking is the analogy between the colonial vassalage to which the
manufacturing states have reduced the planting states and that which
formerly bound the angloamerican colonies to the british empire
england said to her american colonies you shall not trade with the
rest of the world for such manufactures as are produced in the mother
country the manufacturing states say to their southern colonies you
shall not trade with the rest of the world for such manufactures as we
produce the conclusion was inexorable either the south must control
the national government and its economic measures or it must declare
as america had done four score years before its political and economic
independence as northern mills multiplied as railways spun their
mighty web over the face of the north and as accumulated capital rose
into the hundreds of millions the conviction of the planters and their
statesmen deepened into desperation

efforts to start southern industries faila few of them seeing the
predominance of the north made determined efforts to introduce
manufactures into the south to the leaders who were averse to secession
and nullification this seemed the only remedy for the growing disparity
in the power of the two sections societies for the encouragement of
mechanical industries were formed the investment of capital was sought
and indeed a few mills were built on southern soil the results were
meager the natural resources coal and water power were abundant but
the enterprise for direction and the skilled labor were wanting the
stream of european immigration flowed north and west not south the
irish or german laborer even if he finally made his home in a city had
before him while in the north the alternative of a homestead on
western land to him slavery was a strange if not a repelling
institution he did not take to it kindly nor care to fix his home where
it flourished while slavery lasted the economy of the south was
inevitably agricultural while agriculture predominated leadership with
equal necessity fell to the planting interest while the planting
interest ruled political opposition to northern economy was destined to
grow in strength

the southern theory of sectionalismin the opinion of the statesmen
who frankly represented the planting interest the industrial system was
its deadly enemy their entire philosophy of american politics was
summed up in a single paragraph by mcduffie a spokesman for south
carolina owing to the federative character of our government the
great geographical extent of our territory and the diversity of the
pursuits of our citizens in different parts of the union it has so
happened that two great interests have sprung up standing directly
opposed to each other one of these consists of those manufactures which
the northern and middle states are capable of producing but which owing
to the high price of labor and the high profits of capital in those
states cannot hold competition with foreign manufactures without the
aid of bounties directly or indirectly given either by the general
government or by the state governments the other of these interests
consists of the great agricultural staples of the southern states which
can find a market only in foreign countries and which can be
advantageously sold only in exchange for foreign manufactures which come
in competition with those of the northern and middle states these
interests then stand diametrically and irreconcilably opposed to each
other the interest the pecuniary interest of the northern
manufacturer is directly promoted by every increase of the taxes
imposed upon southern commerce and it is unnecessary to add that the
interest of the southern planter is promoted by every diminution of
taxes imposed upon the productions of their industry if under these
circumstances the manufacturers were clothed with the power of imposing
taxes at their pleasure upon the foreign imports of the planter no
doubt would exist in the mind of any man that it would have all the
characteristics of an absolute and unqualified despotism the economic
soundness of this reasoning a subject of interesting speculation for
the economist is of little concern to the historian the historical
point is that this opinion was widely held in the south and with the
progress of time became the prevailing doctrine of the planting
statesmen

their antagonism was deepened because they also became convinced on
what grounds it is not necessary to inquire that the leaders of the
industrial interest thus opposed to planting formed a consolidated
aristocracy of wealth bent upon the pursuit and attainment of
political power at washington by the aid of various associated
interests continued mcduffie the manufacturing capitalists have
obtained a complete and permanent control over the legislation of
congress on this subject the tariff men confederated together upon
selfish and interested principles whether in pursuit of the offices or
the bounties of the government are ever more active and vigilant than
the great majority who act from disinterested and patriotic impulses
have we not witnessed it on this floor sir who ever knew the tariff
men to divide on any question affecting their confederated interests
the watchword is stick together right or wrong upon every question
affecting the common cause such sir is the concert and vigilance and
such the combinations by which the manufacturing party acting upon the
interests of some and the prejudices of others have obtained a decided
and permanent control over public opinion in all the tariff states
thus as the southern statesman would have it the north in matters
affecting national policies was ruled by a confederated interest
which menaced the planting interest as the former grew in magnitude and
attached to itself the free farmers of the west through channels of
trade and credit it followed as night the day that in time the planters
would be overshadowed and at length overborne in the struggle of giants
whether the theory was sound or not southern statesmen believed it and
acted upon it

the planting system and national politics


james madison the father of the federal constitution after he had
watched for many days the battle royal in the national convention of
 exclaimed that the contest was not between the large and the small
states but between the commercial north and the planting south from
the inauguration of washington to the election of lincoln the sectional
conflict discerned by this penetrating thinker exercised a profound
influence on the course of american politics it was latent during the
era of good feeling when the jeffersonian republicans adopted
federalist policies it flamed up in the contest between the democrats
and whigs finally it raged in the angry political quarrel which
culminated in the civil war


slaverynorth and south

the decline of slavery in the northat the time of the adoption of
the constitution slavery was lawful in all the northern states except
massachusetts there were almost as many bondmen in new york as in
georgia new jersey had more than delaware or tennessee indeed nearly
as many as both combined all told however there were only about forty
thousand in the north as against nearly seven hundred thousand in the
south moreover most of the northern slaves were domestic servants not
laborers necessary to keep mills going or fields under cultivation

there was in the north a steadily growing moral sentiment against the
system massachusetts abandoned it in  in the same year
pennsylvania provided for gradual emancipation new hampshire where
there had been only a handful connecticut with a few thousand
domestics and new jersey early followed these examples new york in
 declared that all children born of slaves after july  of that
year should be free though held for a term as apprentices and in 
it swept away the last vestiges of slavery so with the passing of the
generation that had framed the constitution chattel servitude
disappeared in the commercial states leaving behind only such
discriminations as disfranchisement or high property qualifications on
colored voters

the growth of northern sentiment against slaveryin both sections of
the country there early existed among those more or less
philosophically inclined a strong opposition to slavery on moral as
well as economic grounds in the constitutional convention of 
gouverneur morris had vigorously condemned it and proposed that the
whole country should bear the cost of abolishing it about the same time
a society for promoting the abolition of slavery under the presidency
of benjamin franklin laid before congress a petition that serious
attention be given to the emancipation of those unhappy men who alone
in this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage when
congress acting on the recommendations of president jefferson provided
for the abolition of the foreign slave trade on january   several
northern members joined with southern members in condemning the system
as well as the trade later colonization societies were formed to
encourage the emancipation of slaves and their return to africa james
madison was president and henry clay vice president of such an
organization

the antislavery sentiment of which these were the signs was
nevertheless confined to narrow circles and bore no trace of bitterness

we consider slavery your calamity not your crime wrote a
distinguished boston clergyman to his southern brethren and we will
share with you the burden of putting an end to it we will consent that
the public lands shall be appropriated to this object i deprecate
everything which sows discord and exasperating sectional animosities

uncompromising abolitionin a little while the spirit of generosity
was gone just as jacksonian democracy rose to power there appeared a
new kind of antislavery doctrinethe dogmatism of the abolition
agitator for mild speculation on the evils of the system was
substituted an imperious and belligerent demand for instant
emancipation if a date must be fixed for its appearance the year 
may be taken when william lloyd garrison founded in boston his
antislavery paper the liberator with singleness of purpose and
utter contempt for all opposing opinions and arguments he pursued his
course of passionate denunciation he apologized for having ever
assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition
he chose for his motto immediate and unconditional emancipation he
promised his readers that he would be harsh as truth and uncompromising
as justice that he would not think or speak or write with
moderation then he flung out his defiant call i am in earnesti
will not equivocatei will not excusei will not retreat a single
inchand i will be heard

     such is the vow i take so help me god

though garrison complained that the apathy of the people is enough to
make every statue leap from its pedestal he soon learned how alive the
masses were to the meaning of his propaganda abolition orators were
stoned in the street and hissed from the platform their meeting places
were often attacked and sometimes burned to the ground garrison himself
was assaulted in the streets of boston finding refuge from the angry
mob behind prison bars lovejoy a publisher in alton illinois for his
willingness to give abolition a fair hearing was brutally murdered his
printing press was broken to pieces as a warning to all those who
disturbed the nations peace of mind the south doubly frightened by a
slave revolt in  which ended in the murder of a number of men
women and children closed all discussion of slavery in that section
now exclaimed calhoun it is a question which admits of neither
concession nor compromise

as the opposition hardened the antislavery agitation gathered in force
and intensity whittier blew his blast from the new england hills

    no slavehunt in our bordersno pirate on our strand
     no fetters in the bay stateno slave upon our land

lowell looking upon the espousal of a great cause as the noblest aim of
his art ridiculed and excoriated bondage in the south those
abolitionists not gifted as speakers or writers signed petitions
against slavery and poured them in upon congress the flood of them was
so continuous that the house of representatives forgetting its
traditions adopted in  a gag rule which prevented the reading of
appeals and consigned them to the waste basket not until the whigs were
in power nearly ten years later was john quincy adams able after a
relentless campaign to carry a motion rescinding the rule

how deep was the impression made upon the country by this agitation for
immediate and unconditional emancipation cannot be measured if the
popular vote for those candidates who opposed not slavery but its
extension to the territories be taken as a standard it was slight
indeed in  the free soil candidate birney polled  votes
out of over a million and a half the free soil vote of the next
campaign went beyond a quarter of a million but the increase was due to
the strength of the leader martin van buren four years afterward it
receded to  affording all the outward signs for the belief that
the pleas of the abolitionist found no widespread response among the
people yet the agitation undoubtedly ran deeper than the ballot box
young statesmen of the north in whose hands the destiny of frightful
years was to lie found their indifference to slavery broken and their
consciences stirred by the unending appeal and the tireless reiteration
charles sumner afterward boasted that he read the liberator two years
before wendell phillips the young boston lawyer who cast aside his
profession to take up the dangerous cause

early southern opposition to slaveryin the south the sentiment
against slavery was strong it led some to believe that it would also
come to an end there in due time washington disliked it and directed in
his will that his own slaves should be set free after the death of his
wife jefferson looking into the future condemned the system by which
he also lived saying can the liberties of a nation be thought secure
when we have removed their only firm basis a conviction in the minds of
the people that their liberties are the gift of god are they not to be
violated but with his wrath indeed i tremble for my country when i
reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever nor
did southern men confine their sentiments to expressions of academic
opinion they accepted in  the ordinance which excluded slavery from
the northwest territory forever and also the missouri compromise which
shut it out of a vast section of the louisiana territory

the revolution in the slave systemamong the representatives of
south carolina and georgia however the antislavery views of
washington and jefferson were by no means approved and the drift of
southern economy was decidedly in favor of extending and perpetuating
rather than abolishing the system of chattel servitude the invention
of the cotton gin and textile machinery created a market for cotton
which the planters with all their skill and energy could hardly
supply almost every available acre was brought under cotton culture as
the small farmers were driven steadily from the seaboard into the
uplands or to the northwest

the demand for slaves to till the swiftly expanding fields was enormous
the number of bondmen rose from  in washingtons day to more than
three millions in  at the same time slavery itself was transformed
instead of the homestead where the same family of masters kept the same
families of slaves from generation to generation came the plantation
system of the far south and southwest where masters were ever moving and
ever extending their holdings of lands and slaves this in turn reacted
on the older south where the raising of slaves for the market became a
regular and highly profitable business

john c calhoun

slavery defended as a positive goodas the abolition agitation
increased and the planting system expanded apologies for slavery became
fainter and fainter in the south then apologies were superseded by
claims that slavery was a beneficial scheme of labor control calhoun
in a famous speech in the senate in  sounded the new note by
declaring slavery instead of an evil a gooda positive good his
reasoning was as follows in every civilized society one portion of the
community must live on the labor of another learning science and the
arts are built upon leisure the african slave kindly treated by his
master and mistress and looked after in his old age is better off than
the free laborers of europe and under the slave system conflicts
between capital and labor are avoided the advantages of slavery in this
respect he concluded will become more and more manifest if left
undisturbed by interference from without as the country advances in
wealth and numbers

slave owners dominate politicsthe new doctrine of calhoun was
eagerly seized by the planters as they came more and more to overshadow
the small farmers of the south and as they beheld the menace of
abolition growing upon the horizon it formed as they viewed matters a
moral defense for their labor systemsound logical invincible it
warranted them in drawing together for the protection of an institution
so necessary so inevitable so beneficent

though in  the slave owners were only about three hundred and fifty
thousand in a national population of nearly twenty million whites they
had an influence all out of proportion to their numbers they were knit
together by the bonds of a common interest they had leisure and wealth
they could travel and attend conferences and conventions throughout the
south and largely in the north they had the press the schools and the
pulpits on their side they formed as it were a mighty union for the
protection and advancement of their common cause aided by those
mechanics and farmers of the north who stuck by jacksonian democracy
through thick and thin the planters became a power in the federal
government we nominate presidents exultantly boasted a richmond
newspaper the north elects them

this jubilant southern claim was conceded by william h seward a
republican senator from new york in a speech describing the power of
slavery in the national government a party he said is in one sense
a joint stock association in which those who contribute most direct the
action and management of the concern the slaveholders contributing
in an overwhelming proportion to the strength of the democratic party
necessarily dictate and prescribe its policy he went on the
slaveholding class has become the governing power in each of the
slaveholding states and it practically chooses thirty of the sixtytwo
members of the senate ninety of the two hundred and thirtythree
members of the house of representatives and one hundred and five of the
two hundred and ninetyfive electors of president and vicepresident of
the united states then he considered the slave power in the supreme
court that tribunal he exclaimed consists of a chief justice and
eight associate justices of these five were called from slave states
and four from free states the opinions and bias of each of them were
carefully considered by the president and senate when he was appointed
not one of them was found wanting in soundness of politics according to
the slaveholders exposition of the constitution such was the northern
view of the planting interest that from the arena of national politics
challenged the whole country in

slavery in national politics

national aspects of slaveryit may be asked why it was that slavery
founded originally on state law and subject to state government was
drawn into the current of national affairs the answer is simple there
were in the first place constitutional reasons the congress of the
united states had to make all needful rules for the government of the
territories the district of columbia the forts and other property
under national authority so it was compelled to determine whether
slavery should exist in the places subject to its jurisdiction upon
congress was also conferred the power of admitting new states whenever
a territory asked for admission the issue could be raised as to whether
slavery should be sanctioned or excluded under the constitution
provision was made for the return of runaway slaves congress had the
power to enforce this clause by appropriate legislation since the
control of the post office was vested in the federal government it had
to face the problem raised by the transmission of abolition literature
through the mails finally citizens had the right of petition it
inheres in all free government and it is expressly guaranteed by the
first amendment to the constitution it was therefore legal for
abolitionists to present to congress their petitions even if they asked
for something which it had no right to grant it was thus impossible
constitutionally to draw a cordon around the slavery issue and confine
the discussion of it to state politics

there were in the second place economic reasons why slavery was
inevitably drawn into the national sphere it was the basis of the
planting system which had direct commercial relations with the north and
european countries it was affected by federal laws respecting tariffs
bounties ship subsidies banking and kindred matters the planters of
the south almost without exception looked upon the protective tariff
as a tribute laid upon them for the benefit of northern industries as
heavy borrowers of money in the north they were generally in favor of
easy money if not paper currency as an aid in the repayment of their
debts this threw most of them into opposition to the whig program for a
united states bank all financial aids to american shipping they stoutly
resisted preferring to rely upon the cheaper service rendered by
english shippers internal improvements those substantial ties that
were binding the west to the east and turning the traffic from new
orleans to philadelphia and new york they viewed with alarm free
homesteads from the public lands which tended to overbalance the south
by building free states became to them a measure dangerous to their
interests thus national economic policies which could not by any twist
or turn be confined to state control drew the slave system and its
defenders into the political conflict that centered at washington

slavery and the territoriesthe missouri compromise though
men continually talked about taking slavery out of politics it could
not be done by  slavery had become so entrenched and the
antislavery sentiment so strong that missouris quest for admission
brought both houses of congress into a deadlock that was broken only by
compromise the south having half the senators could prevent the
admission of missouri stripped of slavery and the north powerful in
the house of representatives could keep missouri with slavery out of
the union indefinitely an adjustment of pretensions was the last
resort maine separated from the parent state of massachusetts was
brought into the union with freedom and missouri with bondage at the
same time it was agreed that the remainder of the vast louisiana
territory north of the parallel of  o  should be like the old
northwest forever free while the southern portion was left to slavery
in reality this was an immense gain for liberty the area dedicated to
free farmers was many times greater than that left to the planters the
principle was once more asserted that congress had full power to prevent
slavery in the territories

illustration the missouri compromise

the territorial question reopened by the wilmot provisoto the
southern leaders the annexation of texas and the conquest of mexico
meant renewed security to the planting interest against the increasing
wealth and population of the north texas it was said could be divided
into four slave states the new territories secured by the treaty of
peace with mexico contained the promise of at least three more thus as
each new free soil state knocked for admission into the union the
south could demand as the price of its consent a new slave state no
wonder southern statesmen saw in the annexation of texas and the
conquest of mexico slavery and king cotton triumphantsecure for all
time against adverse legislation northern leaders were equally
convinced that the southern prophecy was true abolitionists and
moderate opponents of slavery alike were in despair texas they
lamented would fasten slavery upon the country forevermore no living
man cried one will see the end of slavery in the united states

it so happened however that the events which it was thought would
secure slavery let loose a storm against it a sign appeared first on
august   only a few months after war was declared on mexico on
that day david wilmot a democrat from pennsylvania introduced into
the house of representatives a resolution to the effect that as an
express and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory
from the republic of mexico slavery should be forever excluded from
every part of it the wilmot proviso as the resolution was popularly
called though defeated on that occasion was a challenge to the south

the south answered the challenge speaking in the house of
representatives robert toombs of georgia boldly declared in the
presence of the living god if by your legislation you seek to drive us
from the territories of california and new mexico  i am for
disunion south carolina announced that the day for talk had passed and
the time had come to join her sister states in resisting the
application of the wilmot proviso at any and all hazards a conference
assembled at jackson mississippi in the autumn of  called a
general convention of southern states to meet at nashville the following
summer the avowed purpose was to arrest the course of aggression and
if that was not possible to provide in the last resort for their
separate welfare by the formation of a compact and union that will
afford protection to their liberties and rights states that had
spurned south carolinas plea for nullification in  responded to
this new appeal with alacrityan augury of the secession to come

henry clay

the great debate of the temper of the country was white hot
when congress convened in december  it was a memorable session
memorable for the great men who took part in the debates and memorable
for the grand compromise of  which it produced in the senate sat
for the last time three heroic figures webster from the north calhoun
from the south and clay from a border state for nearly forty years
these three had been leaders of men all had grown old and gray in
service calhoun was already broken in health and in a few months was to
be borne from the political arena forever clay and webster had but two
more years in their allotted span

experience learning statecraftall these things they now marshaled in
a mighty effort to solve the slavery problem on january   clay
offered to the senate a compromise granting concessions to both sides
and a few days later in a powerful oration he made a passionate appeal
for a union of hearts through mutual sacrifices calhoun relentlessly
demanded the full measure of justice for the south equal rights in the
territories bought by common blood the return of runaway slaves as
required by the constitution the suppression of the abolitionists and
the restoration of the balance of power between the north and the south
webster in his notable seventh of march speech condemned the wilmot
proviso advocated a strict enforcement of the fugitive slave law
denounced the abolitionists and made a final plea for the constitution
union and liberty this was the address which called forth from
whittier the poem ichabod deploring the fall of the mighty one whom
he thought lost to all sense of faith and honor

the terms of the compromise of when the debates were closed
the results were totaled in a series of compromise measures all of
which were signed in september  by the new president millard
fillmore who had taken office two months before on the death of zachary
taylor by these acts the boundaries of texas were adjusted and the
territory of new mexico created subject to the provision that all or
any part of it might be admitted to the union with or without slavery
as their constitution may provide at the time of their admission the
territory of utah was similarly organized with the same conditions as to
slavery thus repudiating the wilmot proviso without guaranteeing
slavery to the planters california was admitted as a free state under a
constitution in which the people of the territory had themselves
prohibited slavery

the slave trade was abolished in the district of columbia but slavery
itself existed as before at the capital of the nation this concession
to antislavery sentiment was more than offset by a fugitive slave law
drastic in spirit and in letter it placed the enforcement of its terms
in the hands of federal officers appointed from washington and so
removed it from the control of authorities locally elected it provided
that masters or their agents on filing claims in due form might
summarily remove their escaped slaves without affording their alleged
fugitives the right of trial by jury the right to witness the right
to offer any testimony in evidence finally to put teeth into the
act heavy penalties were prescribed for all who obstructed or assisted
in obstructing the enforcement of the law such was the great compromise
of 

illustration an old cartoon representing webster stealing clays
thunder

the proslavery triumph in the election of the results of the
election of  seemed to show conclusively that the nation was weary
of slavery agitation and wanted peace both parties whigs and
democrats endorsed the fugitive slave law and approved the great
compromise the democrats with franklin pierce as their leader swept
the country against the war hero general winfield scott on whom the
whigs had staked their hopes even webster broken with grief at his
failure to receive the nomination advised his friends to vote for
pierce and turned away from politics to meditate upon approaching death
the verdict of the voters would seem to indicate that for the time
everybody save a handful of disgruntled agitators looked upon clays
settlement as the last word the people especially the business men of
the country says elson were utterly weary of the agitation and they
gave their suffrages to the party that promised them rest the free
soil party condemning slavery as a sin against god and a crime against
man and advocating freedom for the territories failed to carry a
single state in fact it polled fewer votes than it had four years
earlier as against nearly  the combined vote of the
whigs and democrats it is not surprising therefore that president
pierce surrounded in his cabinet by strong southern sympathizers could
promise to put an end to slavery agitation and to crush the abolition
movement in the bud

antislavery agitation continuedthe promise was more difficult to
fulfill than to utter in fact the vigorous execution of one measure
included in the compromisethe fugitive slave lawonly made matters
worse designed as security for the planters it proved a powerful
instrument in their undoing slavery five hundred miles away on a
louisiana plantation was so remote from the north that only the
strongest imagination could maintain a constant rage against it slave
catching man hunting by federal officers on the streets of
philadelphia new york boston chicago or milwaukee and in the hamlets
and villages of the widestretching farm lands of the north was another
matter it brought the most odious aspects of slavery home to thousands
of men and women who would otherwise have been indifferent to the
system lawabiding business men mechanics farmers and women when
they saw peaceful negroes who had resided in their neighborhoods
perhaps for years torn away by federal officers and carried back to
bondage were transformed into enemies of the law they helped slaves to
escape they snatched them away from officers who had captured them
they broke open jails and carried fugitives off to canada

assistance to runaway slaves always more or less common in the north
was by this time organized into a system regular routes known as
underground railways were laid out across the free states into
canada and trusted friends of freedom maintained underground stations
where fugitives were concealed in the daytime between their long night
journeys funds were raised and secret agents sent into the south to
help negroes to flee one negro woman harriet tubman the moses of her
people with headquarters at philadelphia is accredited with nineteen
invasions into slave territory and the emancipation of three hundred
negroes those who worked at this business were in constant peril one
underground operator calvin fairbank spent nearly twenty years in
prison for aiding fugitives from justice yet perils and prisons did not
stay those determined men and women who in obedience to their
consciences set themselves to this lawless work

from thrilling stories of adventure along the underground railways came
some of the scenes and themes of the novel by harriet beecher stowe
uncle toms cabin published two years after the compromise of 
her stirring tale set forth the worst features of slavery in vivid word
pictures that caught and held the attention of millions of readers
though the book was unfair to the south and was denounced as a hideous
distortion of the truth it was quickly dramatized and played in every
city and town throughout the north topsy little eva uncle tom the
fleeing slave eliza harris and the cruel slave driver simon legree
with his baying blood hounds became living specters in many a home that
sought to bar the door to the unpleasant and irritating business of
slavery agitation


the drift of events toward the irrepressible conflict

repeal of the missouri compromiseto practical men after all the
rubadub agitation of a few abolitionists an occasional riot over
fugitive slaves and the vogue of a popular novel seemed of slight or
transient importance they could point with satisfaction to the election
returns of  but their very security was founded upon shifting
sands the magnificent triumph of the proslavery democrats in 
brought a turn in affairs that destroyed the foundations under their
feet emboldened by their own strength and the weakness of their
opponents they now dared to repeal the missouri compromise the leader
in this fateful enterprise was stephen a douglas senator from
illinois and the occasion for the deed was the demand for the
organization of territorial government in the regions west of iowa and
missouri

douglas like clay and webster before him was consumed by a strong
passion for the presidency and to reach his goal it was necessary to
win the support of the south this he undoubtedly sought to do when he
introduced on january   a bill organizing the nebraska territory
on the principle of the compromise of  namely that the people in
the territory might themselves decide whether they would have slavery or
not unwittingly the avalanche was started

after a stormy debate in which important amendments were forced on
douglas the kansasnebraska bill became a law on may   the
measure created two territories kansas and nebraska and provided that
they or territories organized out of them could come into the union as
states with or without slavery as their constitutions may prescribe at
the time of their admission not content with this the law went on to
declare the missouri compromise null and void as being inconsistent with
the principle of nonintervention by congress with slavery in the states
and territories thus by a single blow the very heart of the continent
dedicated to freedom by solemn agreement was thrown open to slavery a
desperate struggle between slave owners and the advocates of freedom was
the outcome in kansas

if douglas fancied that the north would receive the overthrow of the
missouri compromise in the same temper that it greeted clays
settlement he was rapidly disillusioned a blast of rage terrific in
its fury swept from maine to iowa staid old boston hanged him in
effigy with an inscriptionstephen a douglas author of the infamous
nebraska bill the benedict arnold of  city after city burned him
in effigy until as he himself said he could travel from the atlantic
coast to chicago in the light of the fires thousands of whigs and
freesoil democrats deserted their parties which had sanctioned or at
least tolerated the kansasnebraska bill declaring that the startling
measure showed an evident resolve on the part of the planters to rule
the whole country a gage of defiance was thrown down to the
abolitionists an issue was set even for the moderate and timid who had
been unmoved by the agitation over slavery in the far south that issue
was whether slavery was to be confined within its existing boundaries or
be allowed to spread without interference thereby placing the free
states in the minority and surrendering the federal government wholly to
the slave power

the rise of the republican partyevents of terrible significance
swiftly following drove the country like a ship before a gale straight
into civil war the kansasnebraska bill rent the old parties asunder
and called into being the republican party while that bill was pending
in congress many northern whigs and democrats had come to the
conclusion that a new party dedicated to freedom in the territories must
follow the repeal of the missouri compromise several places claim to be
the original home of the republican party but historians generally
yield it to wisconsin at ripon in that state a mass meeting of whigs
and democrats assembled in february  and resolved to form a new
party if the kansasnebraska bill should pass at a second meeting a
fusion committee representing whigs free soilers and democrats was
formed and the name republicanthe name of jeffersons old partywas
selected all over the country similar meetings were held and political
committees were organized

when the presidential campaign of  began the republicans entered the
contest after a preliminary conference in pittsburgh in february they
held a convention in philadelphia at which was drawn up a platform
opposing the extension of slavery to the territories john c fremont
the distinguished explorer was named for the presidency the results
of the election were astounding as compared with the freesoil failure
of the preceding election prominent men like longfellow washington
irving william cullen bryant ralph waldo emerson and george william
curtis went over to the new party and  votes were rolled up for
free labor free speech free men free kansas and fremont
nevertheless the victory of the democrats was decisive their candidate
james buchanan of pennsylvania was elected by a majority of  to 
electoral votes

illustration slave and free soil on eve of civil war

the dred scott decision in his inaugural buchanan vaguely
hinted that in a forthcoming decision the supreme court would settle one
of the vital questions of the day this was a reference to the dred
scott case then pending scott was a slave who had been taken by his
master into the upper louisiana territory where freedom had been
established by the missouri compromise and then carried back into his
old state of missouri he brought suit for his liberty on the ground
that his residence in the free territory made him free this raised the
question whether the law of congress prohibiting slavery north of  o
 was authorized by the federal constitution or not the court might
have avoided answering it by saying that even though scott was free in
the territory he became a slave again in missouri by virtue of the law
of that state the court however faced the issue squarely it held
that scott had not been free anywhere and that besides the missouri
compromise violated the constitution and was null and void

the decision was a triumph for the south it meant that congress after
all had no power to abolish slavery in the territories under the decree
of the highest court in the land that could be done only by an
amendment to the constitution which required a twothirds vote in
congress and the approval of threefourths of the states such an
amendment was obviously impossiblethe southern states were too
numerous but the republicans were not daunted we know said lincoln
the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions and we
shall do what we can to have it overrule this legislatures of northern
states passed resolutions condemning the decision and the republican
platform of  characterized the dogma that the constitution carried
slavery into the territories as a dangerous political heresy at
variance with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself  with
legislative and judicial precedent  revolutionary in tendency and
subversive of the peace and harmony of the country

the panic of in the midst of the acrimonious dispute over the
dred scott decision came one of the worst business panics which ever
afflicted the country in the spring and summer of  fourteen
railroad corporations including the erie michigan central and the
illinois central failed to meet their obligations banks and insurance
companies some of them the largest and strongest institutions in the
north closed their doors stocks and bonds came down in a crash on the
markets manufacturing was paralyzed tens of thousands of working
people were thrown out of employment hunger meetings of idle men were
held in the cities and banners bearing the inscription we want
bread were flung out in new york working men threatened to invade
the council chamber to demand work or bread and the frightened mayor
called for the police and soldiers for this distressing state of
affairs many remedies were offered none with more zeal and persistence
than the proposal for a higher tariff to take the place of the law of
march  a democratic measure making drastic reductions in the rates
of duty in the manufacturing districts of the north the panic was
ascribed to the democratic assault on business so an old issue was
again vigorously advanced preparatory to the next presidential
campaign

the lincolndouglas debatesthe following year the interest of the
whole country was drawn to a series of debates held in illinois by
lincoln and douglas both candidates for the united states senate in
the course of his campaign lincoln had uttered his trenchant saying that
a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government
cannot endure permanently half slave and half free at the same time he
had accused douglas buchanan and the supreme court of acting in
concert to make slavery national this daring statement arrested the
attention of douglas who was making his campaign on the doctrine of
squatter sovereignty that is the right of the people of each
territory to vote slavery up or down after a few longdistance shots
at each other the candidates agreed to meet face to face and discuss
the issues of the day never had such crowds been seen at political
meetings in illinois farmers deserted their plows smiths their forges
and housewives their baking to hear honest abe and the little giant

the results of the series of debates were momentous lincoln clearly
defined his position the south he admitted was entitled under the
constitution to a fair fugitive slave law he hoped that there might be
no new slave states but he did not see how congress could exclude the
people of a territory from admission as a state if they saw fit to adopt
a constitution legalizing the ownership of slaves he favored the
gradual abolition of slavery in the district of columbia and the total
exclusion of it from the territories of the united states by act of
congress

moreover he drove douglas into a hole by asking how he squared
squatter sovereignty with the dred scott decision how in other
words the people of a territory could abolish slavery when the court
had declared that congress the superior power could not do it under
the constitution to this baffling question douglas lamely replied that
the inhabitants of a territory by unfriendly legislation might make
property in slaves insecure and thus destroy the institution this
answer to lincolns query alienated many southern democrats who believed
that the dred scott decision settled the question of slavery in the
territories for all time douglas won the election to the senate but
lincoln lifted into national fame by the debates beat him in the
campaign for president two years later

john browns raidto the abolitionists the line of argument pursued
by lincoln including his proposal to leave slavery untouched in the
states where it existed was wholly unsatisfactory one of them a grim
and resolute man inflamed by a hatred for slavery in itself turned
from agitation to violence these men are all talk what is needed is
actionaction so spoke john brown of new york during the sanguinary
struggle in kansas he hurried to the frontier gun and dagger in hand
to help drive slave owners from the free soil of the west there he
committed deeds of such daring and cruelty that he was outlawed and a
price put upon his head still he kept on the path of action aided by
funds from northern friends he gathered a small band of his followers
around him saying to them if god be for us who can be against us
he went into virginia in the autumn of  hoping as he explained
to effect a mighty conquest even though it be like the last victory of
samson he seized the government armory at harpers ferry declared
free the slaves whom he found and called upon them to take up arms in
defense of their liberty his was a hope as forlorn as it was desperate
armed forces came down upon him and after a hard battle captured him
tried for treason brown was condemned to death the governor of
virginia turned a deaf ear to pleas for clemency based on the ground
that the prisoner was simply a lunatic this is a beautiful country
said the stern old brown glancing upward to the eternal hills on his way
to the gallows as calmly as if he were returning home from a long
journey so perish all such enemies of virginia all such enemies of
the union all such foes of the human race solemnly announced the
executioner as he fulfilled the judgment of the law

the raid and its grim ending deeply moved the country abolitionists
looked upon brown as a martyr and tolled funeral bells on the day of his
execution longfellow wrote in his diary this will be a great day in
our history the date of a new revolution as much needed as the old
one jefferson davis saw in the affair the invasion of a state by a
murderous gang of abolitionists bent on inciting slaves to murder
helpless women and childrena crime for which the leader had met a
felons death lincoln spoke of the raid as absurd the deed of an
enthusiast who had brooded over the oppression of a people until he
fancied himself commissioned by heaven to liberate theman attempt
which ended in little else than his own execution to republican
leaders as a whole the event was very embarrassing they were taunted
by the democrats with responsibility for the deed douglas declared his
firm and deliberate conviction that the harpers ferry crime was the
natural logical inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of
the republican party so persistent were such attacks that the
republicans felt called upon in  to denounce browns raid as among
the gravest of crimes

the democrats dividedwhen the democratic convention met at
charleston in the spring of  a few months after browns execution
it soon became clear that there was danger ahead between the extreme
slavery advocates of the far south and the socalled proslavery
democrats of the douglas type there was a chasm which no appeals to
party loyalty could bridge as the spokesman of the west douglas knew
that while the north was not abolitionist it was passionately set
against an extension of slavery into the territories by act of congress
that squatter sovereignty was the mildest kind of compromise acceptable
to the farmers whose votes would determine the fate of the election
southern leaders would not accept his opinion yancey speaking for
alabama refused to palter with any plan not built on the proposition
that slavery was in itself right he taunted the northern democrats with
taking the view that slavery was wrong but that they could not do
anything about it that he said was the fatal errorthe cause of all
discord the source of black republicanism as well as squatter
sovereignty the gauntlet was thus thrown down at the feet of the
northern delegates you must not apologize for slavery you must
declare it right you must advocate its extension the challenge so
bluntly put was as bluntly answered gentlemen of the south
responded a delegate from ohio you mistake us you mistake us we will
not do it

for ten days the charleston convention wrangled over the platform and
balloted for the nomination of a candidate douglas though in the lead
could not get the twothirds vote required for victory for more than
fifty times the roll of the convention was called without a decision
then in sheer desperation the convention adjourned to meet later at
baltimore when the delegates again assembled their passions ran as
high as ever the division into two irreconcilable factions was
unchanged uncompromising delegates from the south withdrew to richmond
nominated john c breckinridge of kentucky for president and put forth
a platform asserting the rights of slave owners in the territories and
the duty of the federal government to protect them the delegates who
remained at baltimore nominated douglas and endorsed his doctrine of
squatter sovereignty

the constitutional union partywhile the democratic party was being
disrupted a fragment of the former whig party known as the
constitutional unionists held a convention at baltimore and selected
national candidates john bell from tennessee and edward everett from
massachusetts a melancholy interest attached to this assembly it was
mainly composed of old men whose political views were those of clay and
webster cherished leaders now dead and gone in their platform they
sought to exorcise the evil spirit of partisanship by inviting their
fellow citizens to support the constitution of the country the union
of the states and the enforcement of the laws the party that
campaigned on this grand sentiment only drew laughter from the democrats
and derision from the republicans and polled less than onefourth the
votes

the republican conventionwith the whigs definitely forced into a
separate group the republican convention at chicago was fated to be
sectional in character although five slave states did send delegates
as the democrats were split the party that had led a forlorn hope four
years before was on the high road to success at last new and powerful
recruits were found the advocates of a high protective tariff and the
friends of free homesteads for farmers and workingmen mingled with
enthusiastic foes of slavery while still firm in their opposition to
slavery in the territories the republicans went on record in favor of a
homestead law granting free lands to settlers and approved customs
duties designed to encourage the development of the industrial
interests of the whole country the platform was greeted with cheers
which according to the stenographic report of the convention became
loud and prolonged as the protective tariff and homestead planks were
read

having skillfully drawn a platform to unite the north in opposition to
slavery and the planting system the republicans were also adroit in
their selection of a candidate the tariff plank might carry
pennsylvania a democratic state but ohio indiana and illinois were
equally essential to success at the polls the southern counties of
these states were filled with settlers from virginia north carolina
and kentucky who even if they had no love for slavery were no friends
of abolition moreover remembering the old fight on the united states
bank in andrew jacksons day they were suspicious of men from the east
accordingly they did not favor the candidacy of seward the leading
republican statesman and favorite son of new york

after much trading and discussing the convention came to the conclusion
that abraham lincoln of illinois was the most available candidate he
was of southern origin born in kentucky in  a fact that told
heavily in the campaign in the ohio valley he was a man of the soil
the son of poor frontier parents a pioneer who in his youth had labored
in the fields and forests celebrated far and wide as honest abe the
railsplitter it was wellknown that he disliked slavery but was no
abolitionist he had come dangerously near to sewards radicalism in his
housedividedagainstitself speech but he had never committed himself
to the reckless doctrine that there was a higher law than the
constitution slavery in the south he tolerated as a bitter fact
slavery in the territories he opposed with all his strength of his
sincerity there could be no doubt he was a speaker and writer of
singular power commanding by the use of simple and homely language
the hearts and minds of those who heard him speak or read his printed
words he had gone far enough in his opposition to slavery but not too
far he was the man of the hour amid lusty cheers from ten thousand
throats lincoln was nominated for the presidency by the republicans in
the ensuing election he carried all the free states except new jersey

chapter xv

the civil war and reconstruction


the irrepressible conflict is about to be visited upon us through the
black republican nominee and his fanatical diabolical republican
party ran an appeal to the voters of south carolina during the
campaign of  if that calamity comes to pass responded the governor
of the state the answer should be a declaration of independence in a
few days the suspense was over the news of lincolns election came
speeding along the wires prepared for the event the editor of the
charleston mercury unfurled the flag of his state amid wild cheers
from an excited throng in the streets then he seized his pen and wrote
the tea has been thrown overboard the revolution of  has been
initiated the issue was submitted to the voters in the choice of
delegates to a state convention called to cast off the yoke of the
constitution


the southern confederacy

secessionas arranged the convention of south carolina assembled in
december and without a dissenting voice passed the ordinance of
secession withdrawing from the union bells were rung exultantly the
roar of cannon carried the news to outlying counties fireworks lighted
up the heavens and champagne flowed the crisis so long expected had
come at last even the conservatives who had prayed that they might
escape the dreadful crash greeted it with a sigh of relief

illustration the united states in 

the border states in purple remained loyal

south carolina now sent forth an appeal to her sister statesstates
that had in jacksons day repudiated nullification as leading to the
dissolution of the union the answer that came this time was in a
different vein a month had hardly elapsed before five other
statesflorida georgia alabama mississippi and louisianahad
withdrawn from the union in february texas followed virginia
hesitating until the bombardment of fort sumter forced a conclusion
seceded in april but fiftyfive of the one hundred and fortythree
delegates dissented foreshadowing the creation of the new state of west
virginia which congress admitted to the union in  in may north
carolina arkansas and tennessee announced their independence

secession and the theories of the unionin severing their relations
with the union the seceding states denied every point in the northern
theory of the constitution that theory as every one knows was
carefully formulated by webster and elaborated by lincoln according to
it the union was older than the states it was created before the
declaration of independence for the purpose of common defense the
articles of confederation did but strengthen this national bond and the
constitution sealed it forever the federal government was not a
creature of state governments it was erected by the people and derived
its powers directly from them it is said webster the peoples
constitution the peoples government made for the people made by the
people and answerable to the people the people of the united states
have declared that this constitution shall be the supreme law when a
state questions the lawfulness of any act of the federal government it
cannot nullify that act or withdraw from the union it must abide by the
decision of the supreme court of the united states the union of these
states is perpetual ran lincolns simple argument in the first
inaugural the federal constitution has no provision for its own
termination it can be destroyed only by some action not provided for in
the instrument itself even if it is a compact among all the states the
consent of all must be necessary to its dissolution therefore no state
can lawfully get out of the union and acts of violence against the
united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary this was the system
which he believed himself bound to defend by his oath of office
registered in heaven

all this reasoning southern statesmen utterly rejected in their opinion
the thirteen original states won their independence as separate and
sovereign powers the treaty of peace with great britain named them all
and acknowledged them to be free sovereign and independent states
the articles of confederation very explicitly declared that each state
retains its sovereignty freedom and independence the constitution
was a league of nations formed by an alliance of thirteen separate
powers each one of which ratified the instrument before it was put into
effect they voluntarily entered the union under the constitution and
voluntarily they could leave it such was the constitutional doctrine of
hayne calhoun and jefferson davis in seceding the southern states
had only to follow legal methods and the transaction would be correct
in every particular so conventions were summoned elections were held
and sovereign assemblies of the people set aside the constitution in
the same manner as it had been ratified nearly four score years before
thus said the southern people the moral judgment was fulfilled and the
letter of the law carried into effect

illustration jefferson davis

the formation of the confederacyacting on the call of mississippi
a congress of delegates from the seceded states met at montgomery
alabama and on february   adopted a temporary plan of union it
selected as provisional president jefferson davis of mississippi a
man well fitted by experience and moderation for leadership a graduate
of west point who had rendered distinguished service on the field of
battle in the mexican war in public office and as a member of
congress

in march a permanent constitution of the confederate states was
drafted it was quickly ratified by the states elections were held in
november and the government under it went into effect the next year
this new constitution in form was very much like the famous instrument
drafted at philadelphia in  it provided for a president a senate
and a house of representatives along almost identical lines in the
powers conferred upon them however there were striking differences
the right to appropriate money for internal improvements was expressly
withheld bounties were not to be granted from the treasury nor import
duties so laid as to promote or foster any branch of industry the
dignity of the state if any might be bold enough to question it was
safeguarded in the opening line by the declaration that each acted in
its sovereign and independent character in forming the southern union

financing the confederacyno government ever set out upon its career
with more perplexing tasks in front of it the north had a monetary
system the south had to create one the north had a scheme of taxation
that produced large revenues from numerous sources the south had to
formulate and carry out a financial plan like the north the
confederacy expected to secure a large revenue from customs duties
easily collected and little felt among the masses to this expectation
the blockade of southern ports inaugurated by lincoln in april 
soon put an end following the precedent set by congress under the
articles of confederation the southern congress resorted to a direct
property tax apportioned among the states only to meet the failure that
might have been foretold

the confederacy also sold bonds the first issue bringing into the
treasury nearly all the specie available in the southern banks this
specie by unhappy management was early sent abroad to pay for supplies
sapping the foundations of a sound currency system large amounts of
bonds were sold overseas commanding at first better terms than those
of the north in the markets of london paris and amsterdam many an
english lord and statesman buying with enthusiasm and confidence to
lament within a few years the proofs of his folly the difficulties of
bringing through the blockade any supplies purchased by foreign bond
issues however nullified the effect of foreign credit and forced the
confederacy back upon the device of paper money in all approximately
one billion dollars streamed from the printing presses to fall in value
at an alarming rate reaching in january  the astounding figure of
fifty dollars in paper money for one in gold every known device was
used to prevent its depreciation without result to the issues of the
confederate congress were added untold millions poured out by the states
and by private banks

human and material resourceswhen we measure strength for strength
in those signs of powermen money and suppliesit is difficult to
see how the south was able to embark on secession and war with such
confidence in the outcome in the confederacy at the final reckoning
there were eleven states in all to be pitted against twentytwo a
population of nine millions nearly onehalf servile to be pitted
against twentytwo millions a land without great industries to produce
war supplies and without vast capital to furnish war finances joined in
battle with a nation already industrial and fortified by property worth
eleven billion dollars even after the confederate congress authorized
conscription in  southern man power measured in numbers was
wholly inadequate to uphold the independence which had been declared
how therefore could the confederacy hope to sustain itself against

such a combination of men money and materials as the north could
marshal

southern expectationsthe answer to this question is to be found in
the ideas that prevailed among southern leaders first of all they
hoped in vain to carry the confederacy up to the ohio river and with
the aid of missouri to gain possession of the mississippi valley the
granary of the nation in the second place they reckoned upon a large
and continuous trade with great britainthe exchange of cotton for war
materials they likewise expected to receive recognition and open aid
from european powers that looked with satisfaction upon the breakup of
the great american republic in the third place they believed that
their control over several staples so essential to northern industry
would enable them to bring on an industrial crisis in the manufacturing
states i firmly believe wrote senator hammond of south carolina in
 that the slaveholding south is now the controlling power of the
world that no other power would face us in hostility cotton rice
tobacco and naval stores command the world and we have the sense to
know it and are sufficiently teutonic to carry it out successfully the
north without us would be a motherless calf bleating about and die of
mange and starvation

there were other grounds for confidence having seized all of the
federal military and naval supplies in the south and having left the
national government weak in armed power during their possession of the
presidency southern leaders looked to a swift war if it came at all
to put the finishing stroke to independence the greasy mechanics of
the north it was repeatedly said will not fight as to disparity in
numbers they drew historic parallels our fathers a mere handful
overcame the enormous power of great britain a saying of expresident
tyler ran current to reassure the doubtful finally and this point
cannot be too strongly emphasized the south expected to see a weakened
and divided north it knew that the abolitionists and the southern
sympathizers were ready to let the confederate states go in peace that
lincoln represented only a little more than onethird the voters of the
country and that the vote for douglas bell and breckinridge meant a
decided opposition to the republicans and their policies

efforts at compromiserepublican leaders on reviewing the same
facts were themselves uncertain as to the outcome of a civil war and
made many efforts to avoid a crisis thurlow weed an albany journalist
and politician who had done much to carry new york for lincoln proposed
a plan for extending the missouri compromise line to the pacific
jefferson davis warning his followers that a war if it came would be
terrible was prepared to accept the offer but lincoln remembering his
campaign pledges stood firm as a rock against it his followers in
congress took the same position with regard to a similar settlement
suggested by senator crittenden of kentucky

though unwilling to surrender his solemn promises respecting slavery in
the territories lincoln was prepared to give to southern leaders a
strong guarantee that his administration would not interfere directly or
indirectly with slavery in the states anxious to reassure the south on
this point the republicans in congress proposed to write into the
constitution a declaration that no amendment should ever be made
authorizing the abolition of or interference with slavery in any state
the resolution duly passed was sent forth on march   with the
approval of lincoln it was actually ratified by three states before the
storm of war destroyed it by the irony of fate the thirteenth amendment
was to abolish not guarantee slavery

forced the president and congress to turn from negotiations to problems
of warfare little did they realize the magnitude of the task before
them lincolns first call for volunteers issued on april  
limited the number to  put their term of service at three months
and prescribed their duty as the enforcement of the law against
combinations too powerful to be overcome by ordinary judicial process
disillusionment swiftly followed the terrible defeat of the federals at
bull run on july  revealed the serious character of the task before
them and by a series of measures congress put the entire man power of
the country at the presidents command under these acts he issued new
calls for volunteers early in august  he ordered a draft of
militiamen numbering  for nine months service the results were
disappointingominousfor only about  soldiers were added to the
army something more drastic was clearly necessary

in march  lincoln signed the inevitable draft law it enrolled in
the national forces liable to military duty all ablebodied male
citizens and persons of foreign birth who had declared their intention
to become citizens between the ages of twenty and fortyfive
yearswith exemptions on grounds of physical weakness and dependency
from the men enrolled were drawn by lot those destined to active
service unhappily the measure struck a mortal blow at the principle of
universal liability by excusing any person who found a substitute for
himself or paid into the war office a sum not exceeding three hundred
dollars to be fixed by general order this provision so crass and so
obviously favoring the welltodo sowed seeds of bitterness which
sprang up a hundredfold in the north

illustration the draft riots in new york city

the beginning of the drawings under the draft act in new york city on
monday july   was the signal for four days of rioting in the
course of this uprising draft headquarters were destroyed the office
of the tribune was gutted negroes were seized hanged and shot the
homes of obnoxious unionists were burned down the residence of the
mayor of the city was attacked and regular battles were fought in the
streets between the rioters and the police business stopped and a large
part of the city passed absolutely into the control of the mob not
until late the following wednesday did enough troops arrive to restore
order and enable the residents of the city to resume their daily
activities at least a thousand people had been killed or wounded and
more than a million dollars worth of damage done to property the draft
temporarily interrupted by this outbreak was then resumed and carried
out without further trouble

the results of the draft were in the end distinctly disappointing to the
government the exemptions were numerous and the number who preferred
and were able to pay  rather than serve exceeded all expectations
volunteering it is true was stimulated but even that resource could
hardly keep the thinning ranks of the army filled with reluctance
congress struck out the  exemption clause but still favored the
welltodo by allowing them to hire substitutes if they could find them
with all this power in its hands the administration was able by january
 to construct a union army that outnumbered the confederates two to
one

war financein the financial sphere the north faced immense
difficulties the surplus in the treasury had been dissipated by 
and the tariff of  had failed to produce an income sufficient to
meet the ordinary expenses of the government confronted by military and
naval expenditures of appalling magnitude rising from  in
the first year of the war to  in the last year the
administration had to tap every available source of income the duties
on imports were increased not once but many times producing huge
revenues and also meeting the most extravagant demands of the
manufacturers for protection direct taxes were imposed on the states
according to their respective populations but the returns were
meagerall out of proportion to the irritation involved stamp taxes
and taxes on luxuries occupations and the earnings of corporations
were laid with a weight that in ordinary times would have drawn forth
opposition of ominous strength the whole gamut of taxation was run
even a tax on incomes and gains by the year the first in the history of
the federal government was included in the long list

revenues were supplemented by bond issues mounting in size and interest
rate until in october at the end of the war the debt stood at
 the total cost of the war was many times the money value
of all the slaves in the southern states to the debt must be added
nearly half a billion dollars in greenbackspaper money issued by
congress in desperation as bond sales and revenues from taxes failed to
meet the rising expenditures this currency issued at par on
questionable warrant from the constitution like all such paper quickly
began to decline until in the worst fortunes of  one dollar in gold
was worth nearly three in greenbacks

the blockade of southern portsfour days after his call for
volunteers april   president lincoln issued a proclamation
blockading the ports of the southern confederacy later the blockade was
extended to virginia and north carolina as they withdrew from the
union vessels attempting to enter or leave these ports if they
disregarded the warnings of a blockading ship were to be captured and
brought as prizes to the nearest convenient port to make the order
effective immediate steps were taken to increase the naval forces
depleted by neglect until the entire coast line was patrolled with such
a number of ships that it was a rare captain who ventured to run the
gantlet the collision between the merrimac and the monitor in
march  sealed the fate of the confederacy the exploits of the
union navy are recorded in the falling export of cotton  in
  in  and  in 

the deadly effect of this paralysis of trade upon southern war power may
be readily imagined foreign loans payable in cotton could be
negotiated but not paid off supplies could be purchased on credit but
not brought through the drag net with extreme difficulty could the
confederate government secure even paper for the issue of money and
bonds publishers in despair at the loss of supplies were finally
driven to the use of brown wrapping paper and wall paper as the
railways and rolling stock wore out it became impossible to renew them
from england or france unable to export their cotton planters on the
seaboard burned it in what were called fires of patriotism in their
lurid light the fatal weakness of southern economy stood revealed

diplomacythe war had not advanced far before the federal government
became involved in many perplexing problems of diplomacy in europe the
confederacy early turned to england and france for financial aid and for
recognition as an independent power davis believed that the industrial
crisis created by the cotton blockade would in time literally compel
europe to intervene in order to get this essential staple the crisis
came as he expected but not the result thousands of english textile
workers were thrown out of employment and yet while on the point of
starvation they adopted resolutions favoring the north instead of
petitioning their government to aid the south by breaking the blockade

with the ruling classes it was far otherwise napoleon iii the emperor
of the french was eager to help in disrupting the american republic if
he could have won englands support he would have carried out his
designs as it turned out he found plenty of sympathy across the channel
but not open and official cooperation according to the eminent
historian rhodes fourfifths of the british house of lords and most
members of the house of commons were favorable to the confederacy and
anxious for its triumph late in  the british ministers thus
sustained were on the point of recognizing the independence of the
confederacy had it not been for their extreme caution for the constant
and harassing criticism by english friends of the united stateslike
john brightand for the victories of vicksburg and gettysburg both

england and france would have doubtless declared the confederacy to be
one of the independent powers of the earth

illustration john bright

while stopping short of recognizing its independence england and france
took several steps that were in favor of the south in proclaiming
neutrality they early accepted the confederates as belligerents and
accorded them the rights of people at wara measure which aroused anger
in the north at first but was later admitted to be sound otherwise
confederates taken in battle would have been regarded as rebels or
traitors to be hanged or shot napoleon iii proposed to russia in 
a coalition of powers against the north only to meet a firm refusal
the next year he suggested intervention to great britain encountering
this time a conditional rejection of his plans in  not daunted by
rebuffs he offered his services to lincoln as a mediator receiving in
reply a polite letter declining his proposal and a sharp resolution from
congress suggesting that he attend to his own affairs

in both england and france the governments pursued a policy of
friendliness to the confederate agents the british ministry with
indifference if not connivance permitted rams and ships to be built in
british docks and allowed them to escape to play havoc under the
confederate flag with american commerce one of them the alabama
built in liverpool by a british firm and paid for by bonds sold in
england ran an extraordinary career and threatened to break the
blockade the course followed by the british government against the
protests of the american minister in london was later regretted by an
award of a tribunal of arbitration at geneva in  great britain was
required to pay the huge sum of  to cover the damages wrought
by confederate cruisers fitted out in england

illustration william h seward

in all fairness it should be said that the conduct of the north
contributed to the irritation between the two countries seward the
secretary of state was vindictive in dealing with great britain had it
not been for the moderation of lincoln he would have pursued a course
verging in the direction of open war the new york and boston papers
were severe in their attacks on england words were on one occasion at
least accompanied by an act savoring of open hostility in november
 captain wilkes commanding a union vessel overhauled the british
steamer trent and carried off by force two confederate agents mason
and slidell sent by president davis to represent the confederacy at
london and paris respectively this was a clear violation of the right
of merchant vessels to be immune from search and impressment and in
answer to the demand of great britain for the release of the two men
the united states conceded that it was in the wrong it surrendered the
two confederate agents to a british vessel for safe conduct abroad and
made appropriate apologies

emancipationamong the extreme war measures adopted by the northern
government must be counted the emancipation of the slaves in the states
in arms against the union this step was early and repeatedly suggested
to lincoln by the abolitionists but was steadily put aside he knew
that the abolitionists were a mere handful that emancipation might
drive the border states into secession and that the northern soldiers
had enlisted to save the union moreover he had before him a solemn
resolution passed by congress on july   declaring the sole
purpose of the war to be the salvation of the union and disavowing any
intention of interfering with slavery

the federal government though pledged to the preservation of slavery
soon found itself beaten back upon its course and out upon a new tack
before a year had elapsed namely on april   congress resolved
that financial aid should be given to any state that might adopt gradual
emancipation six days later it abolished slavery in the district of
columbia two short months elapsed on june   it swept slavery
forever from the territories of the united states chief justice taney
still lived the dred scott decision stood as written in the book but
the constitution had been reread in the light of the civil war the
drift of public sentiment in the north was being revealed

while these measures were pending in congress lincoln was slowly making
up his mind by july of that year he had come to his great decision
near the end of that month he read to his cabinet the draft of a
proclamation of emancipation but he laid it aside until a military
achievement would make it something more than an idle gesture in
september the severe check administered to lee at antietam seemed to
offer the golden opportunity on the d the immortal document was
given to the world announcing that unless the states in arms returned
to the union by january   the fatal blow at their peculiar
institution would be delivered southern leaders treated it with slight
regard and so on the date set the promise was fulfilled the
proclamation was issued as a war measure adopted by the president as
commanderinchief of the armed forces on grounds of military
necessity it did not abolish slavery it simply emancipated slaves in
places then in arms against federal authority everywhere else slavery
as far as the proclamation was concerned remained lawful

illustration abraham lincoln

to seal forever the proclamation of emancipation and to extend freedom
to the whole country congress in january  on the urgent
recommendation of lincoln transmitted to the states the thirteenth
amendment abolishing slavery throughout the united states by the end
of  the amendment was ratified the house was not divided against
itself it did not fall it was all free

the restraint of civil libertyas in all great wars particularly
those in the nature of a civil strife it was found necessary to use
strong measures to sustain opinion favorable to the administrations
military policies and to frustrate the designs of those who sought to
hamper its action within two weeks of his first call for volunteers
lincoln empowered general scott to suspend the writ of habeas corpus
along the line of march between philadelphia and washington and thus to
arrest and hold without interference from civil courts any one whom he
deemed a menace to the union at a later date the area thus ruled by
military officers was extended by executive proclamation by an act of
march   congress desiring to lay all doubts about the
presidents power authorized him to suspend the writ throughout the
united states or in any part thereof it also freed military officers
from the necessity of surrendering to civil courts persons arrested
under their orders or even making answers to writs issued from such
courts in the autumn of that year the president acting under the terms
of this law declared this ancient and honorable instrument for the
protection of civil liberties the habeas corpus suspended throughout
the length and breadth of the land the power of the government was also
strengthened by an act defining and punishing certain conspiracies
passed on july  a measure which imposed heavy penalties on
those who by force intimidation or threat interfered with the
execution of the law

thus doubly armed the military authorities spared no one suspected of
active sympathy with the southern cause editors were arrested and
imprisoned their papers suspended and their newsboys locked up those
who organized peace meetings soon found themselves in the toils of the
law members of the maryland legislature the mayor of baltimore and
local editors suspected of entertaining secessionist opinions were
imprisoned on military orders although charged with no offense and were
denied the privilege of examination before a civil magistrate a vermont
farmer too outspoken in his criticism of the government found himself
behind the bars until the government in its good pleasure saw fit to
release him these measures were not confined to the theater of war nor
to the border states where the spirit of secession was strong enough to
endanger the cause of union they were applied all through the northern
states up to the very boundaries of canada zeal for the national cause
too often supplemented by a zeal for persecution spread terror among
those who wavered in the singleness of their devotion to the union

these drastic operations on the part of military authorities so foreign
to the normal course of civilized life naturally aroused intense and
bitter hostility meetings of protest were held throughout the country
thirtysix members of the house of representatives sought to put on
record their condemnation of the suspension of the habeas corpus act
only to meet a firm denial by the supporters of the act chief justice
taney before whom the case of a man arrested under the presidents
military authority was brought emphatically declared in a long and
learned opinion bristling with historical examples that the president
had no power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in congress and
out democrats abolitionists and champions of civil liberty denounced
lincoln and his cabinet in unsparing terms vallandigham a democratic
leader of ohio afterward banished to the south for his opposition to
the war constantly applied to lincoln the epithet of caesar wendell
phillips saw in him a more unlimited despot than the world knows this
side of china

sensitive to such stinging thrusts and no friend of wanton persecution
lincoln attempted to mitigate the rigors of the law by paroling many
political prisoners the general policy however he defended in homely
language very different in tone and meaning from the involved reasoning
of the lawyers must i shoot a simpleminded soldier boy who deserts
while i must not touch a hair of the wily agitator who induces him to
desert he asked in a quiet way of some spokesmen for those who
protested against arresting people for talking against the war this
summed up his philosophy he was engaged in a war to save the union and
all measures necessary and proper to accomplish that purpose were
warranted by the constitution which he had sworn to uphold

military strategynorth and souththe broad outlines of military
strategy followed by the commanders of the opposing forces are clear
even to the layman who cannot be expected to master the details of a
campaign or for that matter the maneuvers of a single great battle
the problem for the south was one of defense mainly though even for
defense swift and paralyzing strokes at the north were later deemed
imperative measures the problem of the north was to put it baldly one
of invasion and conquest southern territory had to be invaded and
southern armies beaten on their own ground or worn down to exhaustion
there

in the execution of this undertaking geography as usual played a
significant part in the disposition of forces the appalachian ranges
stretching through the confederacy to northern alabama divided the
campaigns into eastern and western enterprises both were of signal
importance victory in the east promised the capture of the confederate
capital of richmond a stroke of moral worth hardly to be
overestimated victory in the west meant severing the confederacy and
opening the mississippi valley down to the gulf

as it turned out the western forces accomplished their task first
vindicating the military powers of union soldiers and shaking the
confidence of opposing commanders in february  grant captured
fort donelson on the tennessee river rallied wavering unionists in
kentucky forced the evacuation of nashville and opened the way for two
hundred miles into the confederacy at shiloh murfreesboro vicksburg
chickamauga chattanooga desperate fighting followed and in spite of
varying fortunes it resulted in the discomfiture and retirement of
confederate forces to the southeast into georgia by the middle of 
the mississippi valley was open to the gulf the initiative taken out of
the hands of southern commanders in the west and the way prepared for
shermans final strokethe march from atlanta to the seaa maneuver
executed with needless severity in the autumn of

for the almost unbroken succession of achievements in the west by
generals grant sherman thomas and hooker against albert sidney
johnston bragg pemberton and hood the union forces in the east
offered at first an almost equally unbroken series of misfortunes and
disasters far from capturing richmond they had been thrown on the
defensive general after generalmcclellan pope burnside hooker and
meadewas tried and found wanting none of them could administer a
crushing defeat to the confederate troops and more than once the union
soldiers were beaten in a fair battle they did succeed however in
delivering a severe check to advancing confederates under general robert
e lee first at antietam in september  and then at gettysburg in
july checks reckoned as victories though in each instance the
confederates escaped without demoralization not until the beginning of
the next year when general grant supplied with almost unlimited men
and munitions began his irresistible hammering at lees army did the
final phase of the war commence the pitiless drive told at last
general lee on april   seeing the futility of further conflict
surrendered an army still capable of hard fighting at appomattox not
far from the capital of the confederacy

abraham lincolnthe services of lincoln to the cause of union defy
description a judicial scrutiny of the war reveals his thought and
planning in every part of the varied activity that finally crowned
northern arms with victory is it in the field of diplomacy does
seward the secretary of state propose harsh and caustic measures
likely to draw englands sword into the scale lincoln counsels
moderation he takes the irritating message and with his own hand
strikes out erases tones down and interlines exchanging for words
that sting and burn the language of prudence and caution is it a matter
of compromise with the south so often proposed by men on both sides
sick of carnage lincoln is always ready to listen and turns away only
when he is invited to surrender principles essential to the safety of
the union is it high strategy of war a question of the general best
fitted to win gettysburghooker sedgwick or meade lincoln goes in
person to the war department in the dead of night to take counsel with
his secretary and to make the fateful choice

is it a complaint from a citizen deprived as he believes of his civil
liberties unjustly or in violation of the constitution lincoln is ready
to hear it and anxious to afford relief if warrant can be found for it
is a mother begging for the life of a son sentenced to be shot as a
deserter lincoln hears her petition and grants it even against the
protests made by his generals in the name of military discipline do
politicians sow dissensions in the army and among civilians lincoln
grandly waves aside their petty personalities and invites them to think
of the greater cause is it a question of securing votes to ratify the
thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery lincoln thinks it not beneath
his dignity to traffic and huckster with politicians over the trifling
jobs asked in return by the members who hold out against him does a new
york newspaper call him an ignorant western boor lincolns reply is a
letter to a mother who has given her allher sons on the field of
battleand an address at gettysburg both of which will live as long as
the tongue in which they were written these are tributes not only to
his mastery of the english language but also to his mastery of all those
sentiments of sweetness and strength which are the finest flowers of
culture

throughout the entire span of service however lincoln was beset by
merciless critics the fiery apostles of abolition accused him of
cowardice when he delayed the bold stroke at slavery antiwar democrats
lashed out at every step he took even in his own party he found no
peace charles sumner complained our president is now dictator
imperatorwhichever you like but how vain to have the power of a
god and not to use it godlike leaders among the republicans sought to
put him aside in  and place chase in his chair i hope we may never
have a worse man was lincolns quiet answer

wide were the dissensions in the north during that year and the
republicans while selecting lincoln as their candidate again cast off
their old name and chose the simple title of the union party
moreover they selected a southern man andrew johnson of tennessee to
be associated with him as candidate for vice president this combination
the northern democrats boldly confronted with a platform declaring that
after four years of failure to restore the union by the experiment of
war during which under the pretence of military necessity or war power
higher than the constitution the constitution itself has been
disregarded in every part and public liberty and private right alike
trodden down  justice humanity liberty and public welfare demand
that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities to the
end that peace may be restored on the basis of the federal union of the
states it is true that the democratic candidate general mcclellan
sought to break the yoke imposed upon him by the platform saying that
he could not look his old comrades in the face and pronounce their
efforts vain but the party call to the nation to repudiate lincoln and
his works had gone forth the response came giving lincoln 
votes against  for his opponent the bitter things said about
him during the campaign he forgot and forgave when in april  he
was struck down by the assassins hand he above all others in
washington was planning measures of moderation and healing


the results of the civil war

there is a strong and natural tendency on the part of writers to stress
the dramatic and heroic aspects of war but the long judgment of history
requires us to include all other significant phases as well like every
great armed conflict the civil war outran the purposes of those who
took part in it waged over the nature of the union it made a
revolution in the union changing public policies and constitutional
principles and giving a new direction to agriculture and industry

the supremacy of the unionfirst and foremost the war settled for
all time the long dispute as to the nature of the federal system the
doctrine of state sovereignty was laid to rest men might still speak of
the rights of states and think of their commonwealths with affection
but nullification and secession were destroyed the nation was supreme

the destruction of the slave powernext to the vindication of
national supremacy was the destruction of the planting aristocracy of
the souththat great power which had furnished leadership of undoubted
ability and had so long contested with the industrial and commercial
interests of the north the first paralyzing blow at the planters was
struck by the abolition of slavery the second and third came with the
fourteenth  and fifteenth  amendments giving the ballot to
freedmen and excluding from public office the confederate
leadersdriving from the work of reconstruction the finest talents of
the south as if to add bitterness to gall and wormwood the fourteenth
amendment forbade the united states or any state to pay any debts
incurred in aid of the confederacy or in the emancipation of the
slavesplunging into utter bankruptcy the southern financiers who had
stripped their section of capital to support their cause so the
southern planters found themselves excluded from public office and ruled
over by their former bondmen under the tutelage of republican leaders
their labor system was wrecked and their money and bonds were as
worthless as waste paper the south was subject to the north that which
neither the federalists nor the whigs had been able to accomplish in the
realm of statecraft was accomplished on the field of battle


the triumph of industrythe wreck of the planting system was
accompanied by a mighty upswing of northern industry which made the old
whigs of massachusetts and pennsylvania stare in wonderment the demands
of the federal government for manufactured goods at unrestricted prices
gave a stimulus to business which more than replaced the lost markets of
the south between  and  the number of manufacturing
establishments increased  per cent as against  for the previous
decade while the number of persons employed almost doubled there was
no doubt about the future of american industry

the victory for the protective tariffmoreover it was henceforth to
be well protected for many years before the war the friends of
protection had been on the defensive the tariff act of  imposed
duties so low as to presage a tariff for revenue only the war changed
all that the extraordinary military expenditures requiring heavy taxes
on all sources justified tariffs so high that a follower of clay or
webster might well have gasped with astonishment after the war was over
the debt remained and both interest and principal had to be paid
protective arguments based on economic reasoning were supported by a
plain necessity for revenue which admitted no dispute

a liberal immigration policylinked with industry was the labor
supply the problem of manning industries became a pressing matter and
republican leaders grappled with it in the platform of the union party
adopted in  it was declared that foreign immigration which in the
past has added so much to the wealth the development of resources and
the increase of power to this nationthe asylum of the oppressed of all
nationsshould be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just
policy in that very year congress recognizing the importance of the
problem passed a measure of high significance creating a bureau of
immigration and authorizing a modified form of indentured labor by
making it legal for immigrants to pledge their wages in advance to pay
their passage over though the bill was soon repealed the practice
authorized by it was long continued the cheapness of the passage
shortened the term of service but the principle was older than the
days of william penn

the homestead act of in the immigration measure guaranteeing a
continuous and adequate labor supply the manufacturers saw an offset to
the homestead act of  granting free lands to settlers the homestead
law they had resisted in a long and bitter congressional battle
naturally they had not taken kindly to a scheme which lured men away
from the factories or enabled them to make unlimited demands for higher
wages as the price of remaining southern planters likewise had feared
free homesteads for the very good reason that they only promised to add
to the overbalancing power of the north

in spite of the opposition supporters of a liberal land policy made
steady gains freesoil democratsjacksonian farmers and
mechanicslabor reformers and political leaders like stephen a
douglas of illinois and andrew johnson of tennessee kept up the
agitation in season and out more than once were they able to force a
homestead bill through the house of representatives only to have it
blocked in the senate where southern interests were intrenched then
after the senate was won over a democratic president james buchanan
vetoed the bill still the issue lived the republicans strong among
the farmers of the northwest favored it from the beginning and pressed
it upon the attention of the country finally the manufacturers yielded
they received their compensation in the contract labor law in 
congress provided for the free distribution of land in acre lots
among men and women of strong arms and willing hearts ready to build
their serried lines of homesteads to the rockies and beyond

internal improvementsif farmers and manufacturers were early
divided on the matter of free homesteads the same could hardly be said
of internal improvements the western tiller of the soil was as eager
for some easy way of sending his produce to market as the manufacturer
was for the same means to transport his goods to the consumer on the
farm while the confederate leaders were writing into their
constitution a clause forbidding all appropriations for internal
improvements the republican leaders at washington were planning such
expenditures from the treasury in the form of public land grants to
railways as would have dazed the authors of the national road bill half
a century earlier

sound financenational bankingfrom hamiltons day to lincolns
business men in the east had contended for a sound system of national
currency the experience of the states with paper money painfully
impressive in the years before the framing of the constitution had been
convincing to those who understood the economy of business the
constitution as we have seen bore the signs of this experience states
were forbidden to emit bills of credit paper money in short this
provision stood clear in the document but judicial ingenuity had
circumvented it in the age of jacksonian democracy the states had
enacted and the supreme court after the death of john marshall had
sustained laws chartering banking companies and authorizing them to
issue paper money so the country was beset by the old curse the banks
of western and southern states issuing reams of paper notes to help
borrowers pay their debts

in dealing with war finances the republicans attacked this ancient
evil by act of congress in  they authorized a series of national
banks founded on the credit of government bonds and empowered to issue
notes the next year they stopped all bank paper sent forth under the
authority of the states by means of a prohibitive tax in this way by
two measures congress restored federal control over the monetary system
although it did not reestablish the united states bank so hated by
jacksonian democracy

destruction of states rights by fourteenth amendmentthese acts and
others not cited here were measures of centralization and consolidation
at the expense of the powers and dignity of the states they were all of
high import but the crowning act of nationalism was the fourteenth
amendment which among other things forbade states to deprive any
person of life liberty or property without due process of law the
immediate occasion though not the actual cause of this provision was
the need for protecting the rights of freedmen against hostile
legislatures in the south the result of the amendment as was
prophesied in protests loud and long from every quarter of the
democratic party was the subjection of every act of state municipal
and county authorities to possible annulment by the supreme court at
washington the expected happened

few negroes ever brought cases under the fourteenth amendment to the
attention of the courts but thousands of state laws municipal
ordinances and acts of local authorities were set aside as null and
void under it laws of states regulating railway rates fixing hours of
labor in bakeshops and taxing corporations were in due time to be
annulled as conflicting with an amendment erroneously supposed to be
designed solely for the protection of negroes as centralized power over
tariffs railways public lands and other national concerns went to
congress so centralized power over the acts of state and local
authorities involving an infringement of personal and property rights
was conferred on the federal judiciary the apex of which was the
supreme court at washington thus the old federation of independent
states all equal in rights and dignity each wearing the jewel of
sovereignty so celebrated in southern oratory had gone the way of all
flesh under the withering blasts of civil war


reconstruction in the south

theories about the position of the seceded stateson the morning of
april   when general lee surrendered his army to general grant
eleven states stood in a peculiar relation to the union now declared
perpetual lawyers and political philosophers were much perturbed and
had been for some time as to what should be done with the members of the
former confederacy radical republicans held that they were conquered
provinces at the mercy of congress to be governed under such laws as
it saw fit to enact and until in its wisdom it decided to readmit any or
all of them to the union men of more conservative views held that as
the war had been waged by the north on the theory that no state could
secede from the union the confederate states had merely attempted to
withdraw and had failed the corollary of this latter line of argument
was simple the southern states are still in the union and it is the
duty of the president as commanderinchief to remove the federal
troops as soon as order is restored and the state governments ready to
function once more as usual

lincolns proposalsome such simple and conservative form of
reconstruction had been suggested by lincoln in a proclamation of
december   he proposed pardon and a restoration of property
except in slaves to nearly all who had directly or by implication
participated in the existing rebellion on condition that they take an
oath of loyalty to the union he then announced that when in any of the
states named a body of voters qualified under the law as it stood
before secession and equal in number to onetenth the votes cast in
 took the oath of allegiance they should be permitted to
reestablish a state government such a government he added should be
recognized as a lawful authority and entitled to protection under the
federal constitution with reference to the status of the former slaves
lincoln made it clear that while their freedom must be recognized he
would not object to any legislation which may yet be consistent as a
temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring
landless and homeless class

andrew johnsons planhis impeachmentlincolns successor andrew
johnson the vice president soon after taking office proposed to
pursue a somewhat similar course in a number of states he appointed
military governors instructing them at the earliest possible moment to
assemble conventions chosen by that portion of the people of the said
states who are loyal to the united states and proceed to the
organization of regular civil government johnson a southern man and a
democrat was immediately charged by the republicans with being too
ready to restore the southern states as the months went by the
opposition to his measures and policies in congress grew in size and
bitterness the contest resulted in the impeachment of johnson by the
house of representatives in march  and his acquittal by the senate
merely because his opponents lacked one vote of the twothirds required
for conviction

congress enacts reconstruction lawsin fact congress was in a
strategic position it was the lawmaking body and it could moreover
determine the conditions under which senators and representatives from
the south were to be readmitted it therefore proceeded to pass a series
of reconstruction actscarrying all of them over johnsons veto these
measures the first of which became a law on march   betrayed an
animus not found anywhere in lincolns plans or johnsons proclamations

they laid off the ten statesthe whole confederacy with the exception
of tennesseestill outside the pale into five military districts each
commanded by a military officer appointed by the president they ordered
the commanding general to prepare a register of voters for the election
of delegates to conventions chosen for the purpose of drafting new
constitutions such voters however were not to be as lincoln had
suggested loyal persons duly qualified under the law existing before
secession but the male citizens of said state twentyone years old and
upward of whatever race color or previous condition  except such
as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony
at common law this was the death knell to the idea that the leaders of
the confederacy and their white supporters might be permitted to share
in the establishment of the new order power was thus arbitrarily thrust
into the hands of the newly emancipated male negroes and the handful of
whites who could show a record of loyalty that was not all each state
was under the reconstruction acts compelled to ratify the fourteenth
amendment to the federal constitution as a price of restoration to the
union

the composition of the conventions thus authorized may be imagined
bondmen without the asking and without preparation found themselves the
governing power an army of adventurers from the north carpet baggers
as they were called poured in upon the scene to aid in
reconstruction undoubtedly many men of honor and fine intentions gave
unstinted service but the results of their deliberations only
aggravated the open wound left by the war any number of political
doctors offered their prescriptions but no effective remedy could be
found under measures admittedly open to grave objections the southern
states were one after another restored to the union by the grace of
congress the last one in  even this grudging concession of the
formalities of statehood did not mean a full restoration of honors and
privileges the last soldier was not withdrawn from the last southern
capital until  and federal control over elections long remained as
a sign of congressional supremacy

the status of the freedmeneven more intricate than the issues
involved in restoring the seceded states to the union was the question
of what to do with the newly emancipated slaves that problem often put
to abolitionists before the war had become at last a real concern the
thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery had not touched it at all it
declared bondmen free but did nothing to provide them with work or
homes and did not mention the subject of political rights all these
matters were left to the states and the legislatures of some of them
by their famous black codes restored a form of servitude under the
guise of vagrancy and apprentice laws such methods were in fact partly
responsible for the reaction that led congress to abandon lincolns
policies and undertake its own program of reconstruction

still no extensive effort was made to solve by law the economic problems
of the bondmen radical abolitionists had advocated that the slaves when
emancipated should be given outright the fields of their former
masters but congress steadily rejected the very idea of confiscation
the necessity of immediate assistance it recognized by creating in 
the freedmens bureau to take care of refugees it authorized the issue
of food and clothing to the destitute and the renting of abandoned and
certain other lands under federal control to former slaves at reasonable
rates but the larger problem of the relation of the freedmen to the
land it left to the slow working of time

against sharp protests from conservative men particularly among the
democrats congress did insist however on conferring upon the freedmen
certain rights by national law these rights fell into broad divisions
civil and political by an act passed in  congress gave to former
slaves the rights of white citizens in the matter of making contracts
giving testimony in courts and purchasing selling and leasing
property as it was doubtful whether congress had the power to enact
this law there was passed and submitted to the states the fourteenth
amendment which gave citizenship to the freedmen assured them of the
privileges and immunities of citizens of the united states and declared
that no state should deprive any person of his life liberty or
property without due process of law not yet satisfied congress
attempted to give social equality to negroes by the second civil rights
bill of  which promised to them among other things the full and
equal enjoyment of inns theaters public conveyances and places of
amusementa law later declared unconstitutional by the supreme court

the matter of political rights was even more hotly contested but the
radical republicans like charles sumner asserted that civil rights
were not secure unless supported by the suffrage in this same
fourteenth amendment they attempted to guarantee the ballot to all negro
men leaving the women to take care of themselves the amendment
declared in effect that when any state deprived adult male citizens of
the right to vote its representation in congress should be reduced in
the proportion such persons bore to the voting population

this provision having failed to accomplish its purpose the fifteenth
amendment was passed and ratified expressly declaring that no citizen
should be deprived of the right to vote on account of race color or
previous condition of servitude to make assurance doubly secure
congress enacted in   and  three drastic laws sometimes
known as force bills providing for the use of federal authorities
civil and military in supervising elections in all parts of the union
so the federal government having destroyed chattel slavery sought by
legal decree to sweep away all its signs and badges civil social and
political never save perhaps in some of the civil conflicts of greece
or rome had there occurred in the affairs of a nation a social
revolution so complete so drastic and farreaching in its results


summary of the sectional conflict

just as the united states under the impetus of western enterprise
rounded out the continental domain its very existence as a nation was
challenged by a fratricidal conflict between two sections this storm
had been long gathering upon the horizon from the very beginning in
colonial times there had been a marked difference between the south and
the north the former by climate and soil was dedicated to a planting
systemthe cultivation of tobacco rice cotton and sugar caneand in
the course of time slave labor became the foundation of the system the
north on the other hand supplemented agriculture by commerce trade
and manufacturing slavery though lawful did not flourish there an
abundant supply of free labor kept the northern wheels turning

this difference between the two sections early noted by close
observers was increased with the advent of the steam engine and the
factory system between  and  an industrial revolution took
place in the north its signs were gigantic factories huge aggregations
of industrial workers immense cities a flourishing commerce and
prosperous banks finding an unfavorable reception in the south the new
industrial system was confined mainly to the north by canals and
railways new york boston and philadelphia were linked with the
wheatfields of ohio indiana and illinois a steel net wove north and
northwest together a commercial net supplemented it western trade was
diverted from new orleans to the east and eastern credit sustained
western enterprise

in time the industrial north and the planting south evolved different
ideas of political policy the former looked with favor on protective
tariffs ship subsidies a sound national banking system and internal
improvements the farmers of the west demanded that the public domain be
divided up into free homesteads for farmers the south steadily swung
around to the opposite view its spokesmen came to regard most of these
policies as injurious to the planting interests

the economic questions were all involved in a moral issue the northern
states in which slavery was of slight consequence had early abolished
the institution in the course of a few years there appeared
uncompromising advocates of universal emancipation far and wide the
agitation spread the south was thoroughly frightened it demanded
protection against the agitators the enforcement of its rights in the
case of runaway slaves and equal privileges for slavery in the new
territories

with the passing years the conflict between the two sections increased
in bitterness it flamed up in  and was allayed by the missouri
compromise it took on the form of a tariff controversy and
nullification in  it appeared again after the mexican war when the
question of slavery in the new territories was raised again
compromisethe great settlement of seemed to restore peace only
to prove an illusion a series of startling events swept the country
into war the repeal of the missouri compromise in  the rise of the
republican party pledged to the prohibition of slavery in the
territories the dred scott decision of  the lincolndouglas
debates john browns raid the election of lincoln and secession

the civil war lasting for four years tested the strength of both north
and south in leadership in finance in diplomatic skill in material
resources in industry and in armed forces by the blockade of southern
ports by an overwhelming weight of men and materials and by relentless
hammering on the field of battle the north was victorious

the results of the war were revolutionary in character slavery was
abolished and the freedmen given the ballot the southern planters who
had been the leaders of their section were ruined financially and almost
to a man excluded from taking part in political affairs the union was
declared to be perpetual and the right of a state to secede settled by
the judgment of battle federal control over the affairs of states
counties and cities was established by the fourteenth amendment the
power and prestige of the federal government were enhanced beyond
imagination the north was now free to pursue its economic policies a
protective tariff a national banking system land grants for railways
free lands for farmers planting had dominated the country for nearly a
generation business enterprise was to take its place

chapter xvi

the political and economic evolution of the south


the outcome of the civil war in the south was nothing short of a
revolution the ruling class the law and the government of the old
order had been subverted to political chaos was added the havoc wrought
in agriculture business and transportation by military operations and
as if to fill the cup to the brim the task of reconstruction was
committed to political leaders from another section of the country
strangers to the life and traditions of the south


the south at the close of the war

a ruling class disfranchisedas the sovereignty of the planters had
been the striking feature of the old regime so their ruin was the
outstanding fact of the new the situation was extraordinary the
american revolution was carried out by people experienced in the arts of
selfgovernment and at its close they were free to follow the general
course to which they had long been accustomed the french revolution
witnessed the overthrow of the clergy and the nobility but middle
classes who took their places had been steadily rising in intelligence
and wealth

the southern revolution was unlike either of these cataclysms it was
not brought about by a social upheaval but by an external crisis it
did not enfranchise a class that sought and understood power but
bondmen who had played no part in the struggle moreover it struck down
a class equipped to rule the leading planters were almost to a man
excluded from state and federal offices and the fourteenth amendment
was a bar to their return all civil and military places under the
authority of the united states and of the states were closed to every
man who had taken an oath to support the constitution as a member of
congress as a state legislator or as a state or federal officer and
afterward engaged in insurrection or rebellion or given aid and
comfort to the enemies of the united states this sweeping provision
supplemented by the reconstruction acts laid under the ban most of the
talent energy and spirit of the south

the condition of the state governmentsthe legislative executive
and judicial branches of the state governments thus passed into the
control of former slaves led principally by northern adventurers or
southern novices known as scalawags the result was a carnival of
waste folly and corruption the reconstruction assembly of south
carolina bought clocks at  apiece and chandeliers at  to
purchase land for former bondmen the sum of  was appropriated
and swamps bought at seventyfive cents an acre were sold to the state
at five times the cost in the years between  and  the debt of
the state rose from about  to  and millions of the
increase could not be accounted for by the authorities responsible for
it

economic ruinurban and ruralno matter where southern men turned
in  they found devastationin the towns in the country and along
the highways atlanta the city to which sherman applied the torch lay
in ashes nashville and chattanooga had been partially wrecked richmond
and augusta had suffered severely from fires charleston was described
by a visitor as a city of ruins of desolation of vacant houses of
rotten wharves of deserted warehouses of weed gardens of miles of
grassgrown streets how few young men there are how generally the
young women are dressed in black the flower of their proud aristocracy
is buried on scores of battle fields

those who journeyed through the country about the same time reported
desolation equally widespread and equally pathetic an english traveler
who made his way along the course of the tennessee river in  wrote
the trail of war is visible throughout the valley in burntup gin
houses ruined bridges mills and factories  and large tracts of
once cultivated land are stripped of every vestige of fencing the
roads long neglected are in disorder and having in many places become
impassable new tracks have been made through the woods and fields
without much respect to boundaries many a great plantation had been
confiscated by the federal authorities while the owner was in
confederate service many more lay in waste in the wake of the armies
the homes of rich and poor alike if spared the torch had been
despoiled of the stock and seeds necessary to renew agriculture

railways dilapidatedtransportation was still more demoralized this
is revealed in the pages of congressional reports based upon firsthand
investigations one eloquent passage illustrates all the rest from
pocahontas to decatur alabama a distance of  miles we are told
the railroad was almost entirely destroyed except the road bed and
iron rails and they were in a very bad conditionevery bridge and
trestle destroyed crossties rotten buildings burned water tanks
gone tracks grown up in weeds and bushes not a saw mill near the line
and the labor system of the country gone about forty miles of the track
were burned the crossties entirely destroyed and the rails bent and
twisted in such a manner as to require great labor to straighten and a
large portion of them requiring renewal

capital and credit destroyedthe fluid capital of the south money
and credit was in the same prostrate condition as the material capital
the confederate currency inflated to the bursting point had utterly
collapsed and was as worthless as waste paper the bonds of the
confederate government were equally valueless specie had nearly
disappeared from circulation the fourteenth amendment to the federal
constitution had made all debts obligations and claims incurred in
aid of the confederate cause illegal and void millions of dollars
owed to northern creditors before the war were overdue and payment was
pressed upon the debtors where such debts were secured by mortgages on
land executions against the property could be obtained in federal
courts


the restoration of white supremacy

intimidationin both politics and economics the process of
reconstruction in the south was slow and arduous the first battle in
the political contest for white supremacy was won outside the halls of
legislatures and the courts of law it was waged in the main by secret
organizations among which the ku klux klan and the white camelia were
the most prominent the first of these societies appeared in tennessee
in  and held its first national convention the following year it
was in origin a social club according to its announcement its objects
were to protect the weak the innocent and the defenceless from the
indignities wrongs and outrages of the lawless the violent and the
brutal and to succor the suffering especially the widows and orphans
of the confederate soldiers the whole south was called the empire
and was ruled by a grand wizard each state was a realm and each
county a province in the secret orders there were enrolled over half a
million men

the methods of the ku klux and the white camelia were similar solemn
parades of masked men on horses decked in long robes were held
sometimes in the daytime and sometimes at the dead of night notices
were sent to obnoxious persons warning them to stop certain practices
if warning failed something more convincing was tried fright was the
emotion most commonly stirred a horseman at the witching hour of
midnight would ride up to the house of some offender lift his head
gear take off a skull and hand it to the trembling victim with the
request that he hold it for a few minutes frequently violence was
employed either officially or unofficially by members of the klan tar
and feathers were freely applied the whip was sometimes laid on
unmercifully and occasionally a brutal murder was committed often the
members were fired upon from bushes or behind trees and swift
retaliation followed so alarming did the clashes become that in 
congress forbade interference with electors or going in disguise for the
purpose of obstructing the exercise of the rights enjoyed under federal
law

in anticipation of such a step on the part of the federal government
the ku klux was officially dissolved by the grand wizard in 
nevertheless the local societies continued their organization and
methods the spirit survived the national association on the whole
says a southern writer it is not easy to see what other course was
open to the south armed resistance was out of the question and yet
there must be some control had of the situation if force was denied
craft was inevitable

the struggle for the ballot boxthe effects of intimidation were
soon seen at elections the freedman into whose inexperienced hand the
ballot had been thrust was ordinarily loath to risk his head by the
exercise of his new rights he had not attained them by a long and
laborious contest of his own and he saw no urgent reason why he should
battle for the privilege of using them the mere show of force the mere
existence of a threat deterred thousands of exslaves from appearing at
the polls thus the whites steadily recovered their dominance nothing
could prevent it congress enacted force bills establishing federal
supervision of elections and the northern politicians protested against
the return of former confederates to practical if not official power
but all such opposition was like resistance to the course of nature

amnesty for southernersthe recovery of white supremacy in this way
was quickly felt in national councils the democratic party in the north
welcomed it as a sign of its return to power the more moderate
republicans anxious to heal the breach in american unity sought to
encourage rather than to repress it so it came about that amnesty for
confederates was widely advocated yet it must be said that the struggle
for the removal of disabilities was stubborn and bitter lincoln with
characteristic generosity in the midst of the war had issued a general
proclamation of amnesty to nearly all who had been in arms against the
union on condition that they take an oath of loyalty but johnson
vindictive toward southern leaders and determined to make treason
infamous had extended the list of exceptions congress even more
relentless in its pursuit of confederates pushed through the fourteenth
amendment which worked the sweeping disabilities we have just described

to appeals for comprehensive clemency congress was at first adamant in
vain did men like carl schurz exhort their colleagues to crown their
victory in battle with a noble act of universal pardon and oblivion
congress would not yield it would grant amnesty in individual cases
for the principle of proscription it stood fast when finally in 
seven years after the surrender at appomattox it did pass the general
amnesty bill it insisted on certain exceptions confederates who had
been members of congress just before the war or had served in other
high posts civil or military under the federal government were still
excluded from important offices not until the summer of  when the
war with spain produced once more a union of hearts did congress relent
and abolish the last of the disabilities imposed on the confederates

the force bills attacked and nullifiedthe granting of amnesty
encouraged the democrats to redouble their efforts all along the line
in  they captured the house of representatives and declared war on
the force bills as a republican senate blocked immediate repeal they
resorted to an ingenious parliamentary trick to the appropriation bill
for the support of the army they attached a rider or condition to
the effect that no troops should be used to sustain the republican
government in louisiana the senate rejected the proposal a deadlock
ensued and congress adjourned without making provision for the army
satisfied with the technical victory the democrats let the army bill
pass the next session but kept up their fight on the force laws until
they wrung from president hayes a measure forbidding the use of united
states troops in supervising elections the following year they again
had recourse to a rider on the army bill and carried it through putting
an end to the use of money for military control of elections the
reconstruction program was clearly going to pieces and the supreme
court helped along the process of dissolution by declaring parts of the
laws invalid in  the democrats even won a majority in the senate
and returned to power a large number of men once prominent in the
confederate cause

the passions of the war by this time were evidently cooling a new
generation of men was coming on the scene the supremacy of the whites
in the south if not yet complete was at least assured federal
marshals their deputies and supervisors of elections still possessed
authority over the polls but their strength had been shorn by the
withdrawal of united states troops the war on the remaining remnants of
the force bills lapsed into desultory skirmishing when in  the
last fragment was swept away the country took little note of the fact
the only task that lay before the southern leaders was to write in the
constitutions of their respective states the provisions of law which
would clinch the gains so far secured and establish white supremacy
beyond the reach of outside intervention

white supremacy sealed by new state constitutionsthe impetus to
this final step was given by the rise of the populist movement in the
south which sharply divided the whites and in many communities threw
the balance of power into the hands of the few colored voters who
survived the process of intimidation southern leaders now devised new
constitutions so constructed as to deprive negroes of the ballot by law
mississippi took the lead in  south carolina followed five years
later louisiana in  north carolina in  alabama and
maryland in  and virginia in 

the authors of these measures made no attempt to conceal their purposes
the intelligent white men of the south said governor tillman intend
to govern here the fifteenth amendment to the federal constitution
however forbade them to deprive any citizen of the right to vote on
account of race color or previous condition of servitude this made
necessary the devices of indirection they were few simple and
effective the first and most easily administered was the ingenious
provision requiring each prospective voter to read a section of the
state constitution or understand and explain it when read to him by
the election officers as an alternative the payment of taxes or the
ownership of a small amount of property was accepted as a qualification
for voting southern leaders unwilling to disfranchise any of the poor
white men who had stood side by side with them in the dark days of
reconstruction also resorted to a famous provision known as the
grandfather clause this plan admitted to the suffrage any man who did
not have either property or educational qualifications provided he had
voted on or before  or was the son or grandson of any such person

the devices worked effectively of the  negroes in mississippi
above the age of twentyone only about  registered under the
constitution of  louisiana had  colored voters enrolled in
 under the constitution drafted two years later the registration
fell to  an analysis of the figures for south carolina in 
indicates that only about one negro out of every hundred adult males of
that race took part in elections thus was closed this chapter of
reconstruction

the supreme court refuses to intervenenumerous efforts were made to
prevail upon the supreme court of the united states to declare such laws
unconstitutional but the court usually on technical grounds avoided
coming to a direct decision on the merits of the matter in one case
the court remarked that it could not take charge of and operate the
election machinery of alabama it concluded that relief from a great
political wrong if done as alleged by the people of a state and by the
state itself must be given by them or by the legislative and executive
departments of the government of the united states only one of the
several schemes employed namely the grandfather clause was held to
be a violation of the federal constitution this blow effected in 
by the decision in the oklahoma and maryland cases left however the
main structure of disfranchisement unimpaired

proposals to reduce southern representation in congressthese
provisions excluding thousands of male citizens from the ballot did not
in express terms deprive any one of the vote on account of race or
color they did not therefore run counter to the letter of the
fifteenth amendment but they did unquestionably make the states which
adopted them liable to the operations of the fourteenth amendment the
latter very explicitly provides that whenever any state deprives adult
male citizens of the right to vote except in certain minor cases the
representation of the state in congress shall be reduced in the
proportion which such number of disfranchised citizens bears to the
whole number of male citizens over twentyone years of age

mindful of this provision those who protested against disfranchisement
in the south turned to the republican party for relief asking for
action by the political branches of the federal government as the
supreme court had suggested the republicans responded in their platform
of  by condemning all devices designed to deprive any one of the
ballot for reasons of color alone they demanded the enforcement in
letter and spirit of the fourteenth as well as all other amendments
though victorious in the election the republicans refrained from
reopening the ancient contest they made no attempt to reduce southern
representation in the house southern leaders while protesting against
the declarations of their opponents were able to view them as idle
threats in no way endangering the security of the measures by which
political reconstruction had been undone

the solid southout of the thirtyyear conflict against carpetbag
rule there emerged what was long known as the solid southa south
that except occasionally in the border states never gave an electoral
vote to a republican candidate for president before the civil war the
southern people had been divided on political questions take for
example the election of  in all the fifteen slave states the
variety of opinion was marked in nine of themdelaware virginia
tennessee missouri maryland louisiana kentucky georgia and
arkansasthe combined vote against the representative of the extreme
southern point of view breckinridge constituted a safe majority in
each of the six states which were carried by breckinridge there was a
large and powerful minority in north carolina breckinridges majority
over bell and douglas was only  votes equally astounding to those
who imagine the south united in defense of extreme views in  was the
vote for bell the unionist candidate who stood firmly for the
constitution and silence on slavery in every southern state bells vote
was large in virginia kentucky missouri and tennessee it was greater
than that received by breckinridge in georgia it was  against
 in louisiana  against  in mississippi 
against 

the effect of the civil war upon these divisions was immediate and
decisive save in the border states where thousands of men continued to
adhere to the cause of union in the confederacy itself nearly all
dissent was silenced by war men who had been bitter opponents joined
hands in defense of their homes when the armed conflict was over they
remained side by side working against republican misrule and negro
domination by  after northern supremacy was definitely broken
they boasted that there were at least twelve southern states in which no
republican candidate for president could win a single electoral vote

dissent in the solid souththough every one grew accustomed to speak
of the south as solid it did not escape close observers that in a
number of southern states there appeared from time to time a fairly
large body of dissenters in  the populists made heavy inroads upon
the democratic ranks on other occasions the contests between factions
within the democratic party over the nomination of candidates revealed
sharp differences of opinion in some places moreover there grew up a
republican minority of respectable size for example in georgia mr
taft in  polled  votes against  for mr bryan in north
carolina  against  in tennessee  against
 in kentucky  against  in  senator harding
the republican candidate broke the record by carrying tennessee as well
as kentucky oklahoma and maryland


the economic advance of the south

the breakup of the great estatesin the dissolution of chattel
slavery it was inevitable that the great estate should give way before
the small farm the plantation was in fact founded on slavery it was
continued and expanded by slavery before the war the prosperous
planter either by inclination or necessity invested his surplus in
more land to add to his original domain as his slaves increased in
number he was forced to increase his acreage or sell them and he
usually preferred the former especially in the far south still another
element favored the large estate slave labor quickly exhausted the soil
and of its own force compelled the cutting of the forests and the
extension of the area under cultivation finally the planter took a
natural pride in his great estate it was a sign of his prowess and his
social prestige

in  the foundations of the planting system were gone it was
difficult to get efficient labor to till the vast plantations the
planters themselves were burdened with debts and handicapped by lack of
capital negroes commonly preferred tilling plots of their own rented
or bought under mortgage to the more irksome wage labor under white
supervision the land hunger of the white farmer once checked by the
planting system reasserted itself before these forces the plantation
broke up the small farm became the unit of cultivation in the south as
in the north between  and  the number of farms doubled in every
state south of the line of the potomac and ohio rivers except in
arkansas and louisiana from year to year the process of breaking up
continued with all that it implied in the creation of landowning
farmers

the diversification of cropsno less significant was the concurrent
diversification of crops under slavery tobacco rice and sugar were
staples and cotton was king these were standard crops the methods of
cultivation were simple and easily learned they tested neither the
skill nor the ingenuity of the slaves as the returns were quick they
did not call for longtime investments of capital after slavery was
abolished they still remained the staples but farsighted
agriculturists saw the dangers of depending upon a few crops the mild
climate all the way around the coast from virginia to texas and the
character of the alluvial soil invited the exercise of more imagination
peaches oranges peanuts and other fruits and vegetables were found to
grow luxuriantly refrigeration for steamships and freight cars put the
markets of great cities at the doors of southern fruit and vegetable
gardeners the south which in planting days had relied so heavily upon
the northwest for its foodstuffs began to battle for independence
between  and the close of the century the value of its farm crops
increased from  to 

the industrial and commercial revolutionon top of the radical
changes in agriculture came an industrial and commercial revolution the
south had long been rich in natural resources but the slave system had
been unfavorable to their development rivers that would have turned
millions of spindles tumbled unheeded to the seas coal and iron beds
lay unopened timber was largely sacrificed in clearing lands for
planting or fell to earth in decay southern enterprise was consumed in
planting slavery kept out the white immigrants who might have supplied
the skilled labor for industry

after  achievement and fortune no longer lay on the land alone as
soon as the paralysis of the war was over the south caught the
industrial spirit that had conquered feudal europe and the agricultural
north in the development of mineral wealth enormous strides were
taken iron ore of every quality was found the chief beds being in
virginia west virginia tennessee kentucky north carolina georgia
alabama arkansas and texas five important coal basins were uncovered
in virginia north carolina the appalachian chain from maryland to
northern alabama kentucky arkansas and texas oil pools were found
in kentucky tennessee and texas within two decades  to  the
output of mineral wealth multiplied tenfold from ten millions a year to
one hundred millions the iron industries of west virginia and alabama
began to rival those of pennsylvania birmingham became the pittsburgh
and atlanta the chicago of the south

a southern cotton mill in a cotton field

in other lines of industry lumbering and cotton manufacturing took a
high rank the development of southern timber resources was in every
respect remarkable particularly in louisiana arkansas and
mississippi at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century
primacy in lumber had passed from the great lakes region to the south
in  eight southern states produced nearly four times as much lumber
as the lake states and twice as much as the vast forests of washington
and oregon

the development of the cotton industry in the meantime was similarly
astounding in  cotton spinning was a negligible matter in the
southern states in  they had onefourth of the mills of the
country at the end of the century they had onehalf the mills the two
carolinas taking the lead by consuming more than onethird of their
entire cotton crop having both the raw materials and the power at hand
they enjoyed many advantages over the new england rivals and at the
opening of the new century were outstripping the latter in the
proportion of spindles annually put into operation moreover the cotton
planters finding a market at the neighboring mills began to look
forward to a day when they would be somewhat emancipated from absolute
dependence upon the cotton exchanges of new york new orleans and
liverpool

transportation kept pace with industry in  the south had about ten
thousand miles of railway by  the figure had doubled during the
next twenty years over thirty thousand miles were added most of the
increase being in texas about  there opened a period of
consolidation in which scores of short lines were united mainly under
the leadership of northern capitalists and new through service opened
to the north and west thus southern industries were given easy outlets
to the markets of the nation and brought within the main currents of
national business enterprise

the social effects of the economic changesas long as the slave
system lasted and planting was the major interest the south was bound
to be sectional in character with slavery gone crops diversified
natural resources developed and industries promoted the social order
of the antebellum days inevitably dissolved the south became more and
more assimilated to the system of the north in this process several
lines of development are evident

in the first place we see the steady rise of the small farmer even in
the old days there had been a large class of white yeomen who owned no
slaves and tilled the soil with their own hands but they labored under
severe handicaps they found the fertile lands of the coast and river
valleys nearly all monopolized by planters and they were by the force
of circumstances driven into the uplands where the soil was thin and the
crops were light still they increased in numbers and zealously worked
their freeholds

the war proved to be their opportunity with the breakup of the
plantations they managed to buy land more worthy of their plows by
intelligent labor and intensive cultivation they were able to restore
much of the wornout soil to its original fertility in the meantime
they rose with their prosperity in the social and political scale it
became common for the sons of white farmers to enter the professions
while their daughters went away to college and prepared for teaching
thus a more democratic tone was given to the white society of the south
moreover the migration to the north and west which had formerly carried
thousands of energetic sons and daughters to search for new homesteads
was materially reduced the energy of the agricultural population went
into rehabilitation

the increase in the number of independent farmers was accompanied by the
rise of small towns and villages which gave diversity to the life of the
south before  it was possible to travel through endless stretches
of cotton and tobacco the social affairs of the planters family
centered in the homestead even if they were occasionally interrupted by
trips to distant cities or abroad carpentry bricklaying and
blacksmithing were usually done by slaves skilled in simple handicrafts
supplies were bought wholesale in this way there was little place in
plantation economy for villages and towns with their stores and
mechanics

the abolition of slavery altered this small farms spread out where
plantations had once stood the skilled freedmen turned to agriculture
rather than to handicrafts white men of a business or mechanical bent
found an opportunity to serve the needs of their communities so local
merchants and mechanics became an important element in the social
system in the county seats once dominated by the planters business
and professional men assumed the leadership

another vital outcome of this revolution was the transference of a large
part of planting enterprise to business mr bruce a southern historian
of fine scholarship has summed up this process in a single telling
paragraph the higher planting class that under the old system gave so
much distinction to rural life has so far as it has survived at all
been concentrated in the cities the families that in the time of
slavery would have been found only in the country are now found with a
few exceptions in the towns the transplantation has been practically
universal the talent the energy the ambition that formerly sought
expression in the management of great estates and the control of hosts
of slaves now seek a field of action in trade in manufacturing
enterprises or in the general enterprises of development this was for
the ruling class of the south the natural outcome of the great economic
revolution that followed the war

as in all other parts of the world the mechanical revolution was
attended by the growth of a population of industrial workers dependent
not upon the soil but upon wages for their livelihood when jefferson
davis was inaugurated president of the southern confederacy there were
approximately only one hundred thousand persons employed in southern
manufactures as against more than a million in northern mills fifty
years later georgia and alabama alone had more than one hundred and
fifty thousand wageearners necessarily this meant also a material
increase in urban population although the wide dispersion of cotton
spinning among small centers prevented the congestion that had
accompanied the rise of the textile industry in new england in 
new orleans atlanta memphis nashville and houston stood in the same
relation to the new south that cincinnati chicago cleveland and
detroit had stood to the new west fifty years before the problems of
labor and capital and municipal administration which the earlier
writers boasted would never perplex the planting south had come in full
force

the revolution in the status of the slavesno part of southern
society was so profoundly affected by the civil war and economic
reconstruction as the former slaves on the day of emancipation they
stood free but emptyhanded the owners of no tools or property the
masters of no trade and wholly inexperienced in the arts of selfhelp
that characterized the whites in general they had never been accustomed
to looking out for themselves the plantation bell had called them to
labor and released them doles of food and clothing had been regularly
made in given quantities they did not understand wages ownership
renting contracts mortgages leases bills or accounts

when they were emancipated four courses were open to them they could
flee from the plantation to the nearest town or city or to the distant
north to seek a livelihood thousands of them chose this way
overcrowding cities where disease mowed them down they could remain
where they were in their cabins and work for daily wages instead of
food clothing and shelter this second course the major portion of
them chose but as few masters had cash to dispense the new relation
was much like the old in fact it was still one of barter the planter
offered food clothing and shelter the former slaves gave their labor
in return that was the best that many of them could do

a third course open to freedmen was that of renting from the former
master paying him usually with a share of the produce of the land this
way a large number of them chose it offered them a chance to become
land owners in time and it afforded an easier life the renter being to
a certain extent at least master of his own hours of labor the final
and most difficult path was that to ownership of land many a master
helped his former slaves to acquire small holdings by offering easy
terms the more enterprising and the more fortunate who started life as
renters or wageearners made their way upward to ownership in so many
cases that by the end of the century onefourth of the colored laborers
on the land owned the soil they tilled

in the meantime the south though relatively poor made relatively
large expenditures for the education of the colored population by the
opening of the twentieth century facilities were provided for more than
onehalf of the colored children of school age while in many respects
this progress was disappointing its significance to be appreciated
must be derived from a comparison with the total illiteracy which
prevailed under slavery

in spite of all that happened however the status of the negroes in the
south continued to give a peculiar character to that section of the
country they were almost entirely excluded from the exercise of the
suffrage especially in the far south special rooms were set aside for
them at the railway stations and special cars on the railway lines in
the field of industry calling for technical skill it appears from the
census figures that they lost ground between  and a condition
which their friends ascribed to discriminations against them in law and
in labor organizations and their critics ascribed to their lack of
aptitude whatever may be the truth the fact remained that at the
opening of the twentieth century neither the hopes of the emancipators
nor the fears of their opponents were realized the marks of the
peculiar institution were still largely impressed upon southern
society

the situation however was by no means unchanging on the contrary
there was a decided drift in affairs for one thing the proportion of
negroes in the south had slowly declined by  they were in a
majority in only two states south carolina and mississippi in
arkansas virginia west virginia and north carolina the proportion of
the white population was steadily growing the colored migration
northward increased while the westward movement of white farmers which
characterized pioneer days declined at the same time a part of the
foreign immigration into the united states was diverted southward as
the years passed these tendencies gained momentum the already huge
colored quarters in some northern cities were widely expanded as whole
counties in the south were stripped of their colored laborers the race
question in its political and economic aspects became less and less
sectional more and more national the south was drawn into the main
stream of national life the separatist forces which produced the
cataclysm of  sank irresistibly into the background

chapter xvii

business enterprise and the republican party


if a single phrase be chosen to characterize american life during the
generation that followed the age of douglas and lincoln it must be
business enterprisethe tremendous irresistible energy of a virile
people mounting in numbers toward a hundred million and applied without
let or hindrance to the developing of natural resources of unparalleled
richness the chief goal of this effort was high profits for the
captains of industry on the one hand and high wages for the workers
on the other its signs to use the language of a republican orator in
 were golden harvest fields whirling spindles turning wheels
open furnace doors flaming forges and chimneys filled with eager fire
the device blazoned on its shield and written over its factory doors was
prosperity a republican president was its advance agent released
from the hampering interference of the southern planters and the
confusing issues of the slavery controversy business enterprise sprang
forward to the task of winning the entire country then it flung its
outposts to the uttermost parts of the eartheurope africa and the
orientwhere were to be found markets for american goods and natural
resources for american capital to develop


railways and industry

the outward signs of enterpriseit is difficult to comprehend all
the multitudinous activities of american business energy or to appraise
its effects upon the life and destiny of the american people for beyond
the horizon of the twentieth century lie consequences as yet undreamed
of in our poor philosophy statisticians attempt to record its
achievements in terms of miles of railways built factories opened men
and women employed fortunes made wages paid cities founded rivers
spanned boxes bales and tons produced historians apply standards of
comparison with the past against the slow and leisurely stagecoach
they set the swift express rushing from new york to san francisco in
less time than washington consumed in his triumphal tour from mt vernon
to new york for his first inaugural against the lazy sailing vessel
drifting before a genial breeze they place the turbine steamer crossing
the atlantic in five days or the still swifter airplane in fifteen
hours for the old workshop where a master and a dozen workmen and
apprentices wrought by hand they offer the giant factory where ten
thousand persons attend the whirling wheels driven by steam they write
of the romance of invention and the captains of industry

a corner in the bethlehem steel works

the service of the railwayall this is fitting in its way figures
and contrasts cannot however tell the whole story take for example
the extension of railways it is easy to relate that there were 
miles in   in  and  in  it is easy to show
upon the map how a few straggling lines became a perfect mesh of closely
knitted railways or how like the tentacles of a great monster the few
roads ending in the mississippi valley in  were extended and
multiplied until they tapped every wheat field mine and forest beyond
the valley all this eloquent of enterprise as it truly is does not
reveal the significance of railways for american life it does not
indicate how railways made a continental market for american goods nor
how they standardized the whole country giving to cities on the
advancing frontier the leading features of cities in the old east nor
how they carried to the pioneer the comforts of civilization nor yet
how in the west they were the forerunners of civilization the makers of
homesteads the builders of states

government aid for railwaysstill the story is not ended the
significant relation between railways and politics must not be
overlooked the bounty of a lavish government for example made
possible the work of railway promoters by the year  the federal
government had granted in aid of railways  acres of landan
area estimated as almost equal to pennsylvania new york connecticut
rhode island massachusetts maine new hampshire and vermont the
union pacific company alone secured from the federal government a free
right of way through the public domain twenty sections of land with
each mile of railway and a loan up to fifty millions of dollars secured
by a second mortgage on the companys property more than half of the
northern tier of states lying against canada from lake michigan to the
pacific was granted to private companies in aid of railways and wagon
roads about half of new mexico arizona and california was also given
outright to railway companies these vast grants from the federal
government were supplemented by gifts from the states in land and by
subscriptions amounting to more than two hundred million dollars the
history of these gifts and their relation to the political leaders that
engineered them would alone fill a large and interesting volume

railway fortunes and capitalout of this gigantic railway promotion
the first really immense american fortunes were made henry adams the
grandson of john quincy adams related that his grandfather on his
mothers side peter brooks on his death in  left a fortune of two
million dollars supposed to be the largest estate in boston then one
of the few centers of great riches compared with the opulence that
sprang out of the union pacific the northern pacific the southern
pacific with their subsidiary and component lines the estate of peter
brooks was a poor mans heritage

the capital invested in these railways was enormous beyond the
imagination of the men of the stagecoach generation the total debt of
the united states incurred in the revolutionary wara debt which those
of little faith thought the country could never paywas reckoned at a
figure well under  when the union pacific railroad was
completed there were outstanding against it  in first
mortgage bonds  in second mortgage bonds held by the
government  in income bonds  in land grant
bonds and on top of that huge bonded indebtedness  in
stockmaking  in all if the amount due the united states
government be subtracted still there remained in private hands stocks
and bonds exceeding in value the whole national debt of hamiltons
daya debt that strained all the resources of the federal government in
 such was the financial significance of the railways

illustration railroads of the united states in 

growth and extension of industryin the field of manufacturing
mining and metal working the results of business enterprise far
outstripped if measured in mere dollars the results of railway
construction by the end of the century there were about ten billion
dollars invested in factories alone and five million wageearners
employed in them while the total value of the output fourteen billion
dollars was fifteen times the figure for  in the eastern states
industries multiplied in the northwest territory the old home of
jacksonian democracy they overtopped agriculture by the end of the
century ohio had almost reached and illinois had surpassed
massachusetts in the annual value of manufacturing output

that was not all untold wealth in the form of natural resources was
discovered in the south and west coal deposits were found in the
appalachians stretching from pennsylvania down to alabama in michigan
in the mississippi valley and in the western mountains from north
dakota to new mexico in nearly every coalbearing region iron was also
discovered and the great fields of michigan wisconsin and minnesota
soon rivaled those of the appalachian area copper lead gold and
silver in fabulous quantities were unearthed by the restless prospectors
who left no plain or mountain fastness unexplored petroleum first
pumped from the wells of pennsylvania in the summer of  made new
fortunes equaling those of trade railways and land speculation it
scattered its riches with an especially lavish hand through oklahoma
texas and california

the trustan instrument of industrial progressbusiness enterprise
under the direction of powerful men working singlehanded or of small
groups of men pooling their capital for one or more undertakings had
not advanced far before there appeared upon the scene still mightier
leaders of even greater imagination new constructive genius now brought
together and combined under one management hundreds of concerns or
thousands of miles of railways revealing the magic strength of
cooperation on a national scale pricecutting in oil threatening ruin
to those engaged in the industry as early as  led a number of
companies in cleveland pittsburgh and philadelphia to unite in
pricefixing three years later a group of oil interests formed a close
organization placing all their stocks in the hands of trustees among
whom was john d rockefeller the trustees in turn issued
certificates representing the share to which each participant was
entitled and took over the management of the entire business such was
the nature of the trust which was to play such an unique role in the
progress of america

the idea of combination was applied in time to iron and steel copper
lead sugar cordage coal and other commodities until in each field
there loomed a giant trust or corporation controlling if not most of
the output at least enough to determine in a large measure the prices
charged to consumers with the passing years the railways mills
mines and other business concerns were transferred from individual
owners to corporations at the end of the nineteenth century the whole
face of american business was changed threefourths of the output from
industries came from factories under corporate management and only
onefourth from individual and partnership undertakings

illustration john d rockefeller

the banking corporationvery closely related to the growth of
business enterprise on a large scale was the system of banking in the
old days before banks a person with savings either employed them in his
own undertakings lent them to a neighbor or hid them away where they
set no industry in motion even in the early stages of modern business
it was common for a manufacturer to rise from small beginnings by
financing extensions out of his own earnings and profits this state of
affairs was profoundly altered by the growth of the huge corporations
requiring millions and even billions of capital the banks once an
adjunct to business became the leaders in business

illustration copyright by underwood and underwood ny

wall street new york city

it was the banks that undertook to sell the stocks and bonds issued by
new corporations and trusts and to supply them with credit to carry on
their operations indeed many of the great mergers or combinations in
business were initiated by magnates in the banking world with millions
and billions under their control through their connections with one
another the banks formed a perfect network of agencies gathering up the
pennies and dollars of the masses as well as the thousands of the rich
and pouring them all into the channels of business and manufacturing
in this growth of banking on a national scale it was inevitable that a
few great centers like wall street in new york or state street in
boston should rise to a position of dominance both in concentrating the
savings and profits of the nation and in financing new as well as old
corporations

the significance of the corporationthe corporation in fact became
the striking feature of american business life one of the most
marvelous institutions of all time comparable in wealth and power and
the number of its servants with kingdoms and states of old the effect
of its rise and growth cannot be summarily estimated but some special
facts are obvious it made possible gigantic enterprises once entirely
beyond the reach of any individual no matter how rich it eliminated
many of the futile and costly wastes of competition in connection with
manufacture advertising and selling it studied the cheapest methods
of production and shut down mills that were poorly equipped or
disadvantageously located it established laboratories for research in
industry chemistry and mechanical inventions through the sale of
stocks and bonds it enabled tens of thousands of people to become
capitalists if only in a small way the corporation made it possible
for one person to own for instance a  share in a million dollar
business concerna thing entirely impossible under a regime of
individual owners and partnerships

there was of course another side to the picture many of the
corporations sought to become monopolies and to make profits not by
economies and good management but by extortion from purchasers
sometimes they mercilessly crushed small business men their
competitors bribed members of legislatures to secure favorable laws
and contributed to the campaign funds of both leading parties wherever
a trust approached the position of a monopoly it acquired a dominion
over the labor market which enabled it to break even the strongest trade
unions in short the power of the trust in finance in manufacturing
in politics and in the field of labor control can hardly be measured

the corporation and laborin the development of the corporation
there was to be observed a distinct severing of the old ties between
master and workmen which existed in the days of small industries for
the personal bond between the owner and the employees was substituted a
new relation in most parts of our country as president wilson once
said men work not for themselves not as partners in the old way in
which they used to work but generally as employeesin a higher or
lower gradeof great corporations the owner disappeared from the
factory and in his place came the manager representing the usually
invisible stockholders and dependent for his success upon his ability to
make profits for the owners hence the term soulless corporation
which was to exert such a deep influence on american thinking about
industrial relations

cities and immigrationexpressed in terms of human life this era of
unprecedented enterprise meant huge industrial cities and an immense
labor supply derived mainly from european immigration here too
figures tell only a part of the story in washingtons day ninetenths
of the american people were engaged in agriculture and lived in the
country in  more than onethird of the population dwelt in towns of
 and over in  more than half of the population lived in towns
of over  in forty years between  and  greater new york
had grown from  to  san francisco from  to
 chicago from  to  the miles of city tenements
began to rival in the number of their residents the farm homesteads of
the west the time so dreaded by jefferson had arrived people were
piled upon one another in great cities and the republic of small
farmers had passed away

to these industrial centers flowed annually an everincreasing tide of
immigration reaching the half million point in  rising to
threequarters of a million three years later and passing the million
mark in a single year at the opening of the new century immigration was
as old as america but new elements now entered the situation in the
first place there were radical changes in the nationality of the
newcomers the migration from northern europeengland ireland
germany and scandinaviadiminished that from italy russia and
austriahungary increased more than threefourths of the entire number
coming from these three lands between the years  and  these
later immigrants were italians poles magyars czechs slovaks
russians and jews who came from countries far removed from the
language and the traditions of england whence came the founders of
america

in the second place the reception accorded the newcomers differed from
that given to the immigrants in the early days by  all the free
land was gone they could not therefore be dispersed widely among the
native americans to assimilate quickly and unconsciously the habits and
ideas of american life on the contrary they were diverted mainly to
the industrial centers there they crowdednay overcrowdedinto
colonies of their own where they preserved their languages their
newspapers and their oldworld customs and views

so eager were american business men to get an enormous labor supply that
they asked few questions about the effect of this alien invasion upon
the old america inherited from the fathers they even stimulated the
invasion artificially by importing huge armies of foreigners under
contract to work in specified mines and mills there seemed to be no
limit to the factories forges refineries and railways that could be
built to the multitudes that could be employed in conquering a
continent as for the future that was in the hands of providence

business theories of politicsas the statesmen of hamiltons school
and the planters of calhouns had their theories of government and
politics so the leaders in business enterprise had theirs it was
simple and easily stated it is the duty of the government they
urged to protect american industry against foreign competition by
means of high tariffs on imported goods to aid railways by generous
grants of land to sell mineral and timber lands at low prices to
energetic men ready to develop them and then to leave the rest to the
initiative and drive of individuals and companies all government
interference with the management prices rates charges and conduct of
private business they held to be either wholly pernicious or intolerably
impertinent judging from their speeches and writings they conceived
the nation as a great collection of individuals companies and labor
unions all struggling for profits or high wages and held together by a
government whose principal duty was to keep the peace among them and
protect industry against the foreign manufacturer such was the
political theory of business during the generation that followed the
civil war


the supremacy of the republican party 

business men and republican policiesmost of the leaders in industry
gravitated to the republican ranks they worked in the north and the
republican party was essentially northern it was moreoverat least so
far as the majority of its members were concernedcommitted to
protective tariffs a sound monetary and banking system the promotion
of railways and industry by land grants and the development of internal
improvements it was furthermore generous in its immigration policy it
proclaimed america to be an asylum for the oppressed of all countries
and flung wide the doors for immigrants eager to fill the factories man
the mines and settle upon western lands in a word the republicans
stood for all those specific measures which favored the enlargement and
prosperity of business at the same time they resisted government
interference with private enterprise they did not regulate railway
rates prosecute trusts for forming combinations or prevent railway
companies from giving lower rates to some shippers than to others to
sum it up the political theories of the republican party for three
decades after the civil war were the theories of american
businessprosperous and profitable industries for the owners and the
full dinner pail for the workmen naturally a large portion of those
who flourished under its policies gave their support to it voted for
its candidates and subscribed to its campaign funds

sources of republican strength in the norththe republican party was
in fact a political organization of singular power it originated in a
wave of moral enthusiasm having attracted to itself if not the
abolitionists certainly all those idealists like james russell lowell
and george william curtis who had opposed slavery when opposition was
neither safe nor popular to moral principles it added practical
considerations business men had confidence in it workingmen who
longed for the independence of the farmer owed to its indulgent land
policy the opportunity of securing free homesteads in the west the
immigrant landing penniless on these shores as a result of the same
beneficent system often found himself in a little while with an estate
as large as many a baronial domain in the old world under a republican
administration the union had been saved to it the veterans of the war
could turn with confidence for those rewards of service which the
government could bestow pensions surpassing in liberality anything that
the world had ever seen under a republican administration also the
great debt had been created in the defense of the union and to the
republican party every investor in government bonds could look for the
full and honorable discharge of the interest and principal the spoils
system inaugurated by jacksonian democracy in turn placed all the
federal offices in republican hands furnishing an army of party workers
to be counted on for loyal service in every campaign

of all these things republican leaders made full and vigorous use
sometimes ascribing to the party in accordance with ancient political
usage merits and achievements not wholly its own particularly was this
true in the case of saving the union when in the economy of
providence this land was to be purged of human slavery  the
republican party came into power ran a declaration in one platform
the republican party suppressed a gigantic rebellion emancipated four
million slaves decreed the equal citizenship of all and established
universal suffrage ran another as for the aid rendered by the
millions of northern democrats who stood by the union and the tens of
thousands of them who actually fought in the union army the republicans
in their zeal were inclined to be oblivious they repeatedly charged the
democratic party with being the same in character and spirit as when it
sympathized with treason

republican control of the southto the strength enjoyed in the
north the republicans for a long time added the advantages that came
from control over the former confederate states where the newly
enfranchised negroes under white leadership gave a grateful support to
the party responsible for their freedom in this branch of politics
motives were so mixed that no historian can hope to appraise them all at
their proper values on the one side of the ledger must be set the
vigorous efforts of the honest and sincere friends of the freedmen to
win for them complete civil and political equality wiping out not only
slavery but all its badges of misery and servitude on the same side
must be placed the labor of those who had valiantly fought in forum and
field to save the union and who regarded continued republican supremacy
after the war as absolutely necessary to prevent the former leaders in
secession from coming back to power at the same time there were
undoubtedly some men of the baser sort who looked on politics as a game
and who made use of carpetbagging in the south to win the spoils that
might result from it at all events both by laws and presidential acts
the republicans for many years kept a keen eye upon the maintenance of
their dominion in the south their declaration that neither the law nor
its administration should admit any discrimination in respect of
citizens by reason of race color or previous condition of servitude
appealed to idealists and brought results in elections even south
carolina where reposed the ashes of john c calhoun went republican in
 by a vote of three to one

republican control was made easy by the force bills described in a
previous chaptermeasures which vested the supervision of elections in
federal officers appointed by republican presidents these drastic
measures departing from american tradition the republican authors
urged were necessary to safeguard the purity of the ballot not merely
in the south where the timid freedman might readily be frightened from
using it but also in the north particularly in new york city where it
was claimed that fraud was regularly practiced by democratic leaders

the democrats on their side indignantly denied the charges replying
that the force bills were nothing but devices created by the republicans
for the purpose of securing their continued rule through systematic
interference with elections even the measures of reconstruction were
deemed by democratic leaders as thinly veiled schemes to establish
republican power throughout the country nor is there the slightest
doubt exclaimed samuel j tilden spokesman of the democrats in new
york and candidate for president in  that the paramount object and
motive of the republican party is by these means to secure itself
against a reaction of opinion adverse to it in our great populous
northern commonwealths when the republican party resolved to
establish negro supremacy in the ten states in order to gain to itself
the representation of those states in congress it had to begin by
governing the people of those states by the sword the next was the
creation of new electoral bodies for those ten states in which by
exclusions by disfranchisements and proscriptions by control over
registration by applying test oaths  by intimidation and by every
form of influence three million negroes are made to predominate over
four and a half million whites

the war as a campaign issueeven the repeal of force bills could not
allay the sectional feelings engendered by the war the republicans
could not forgive the men who had so recently been in arms against the
union and insisted on calling them traitors and rebels the
southerners smarting under the reconstruction acts could regard the
republicans only as political oppressors the passions of the war had
been too strong the distress too deep to be soon forgotten the
generation that went through it all remembered it all for twenty
years the republicans in their speeches and platforms made a
straight appeal to the patriotism of the northern voters they
maintained that their party which had saved the union and emancipated
the slaves was alone worthy of protecting the union and uplifting the
freedmen

though the democrats especially in the north resented this policy and
dubbed it with the expressive but inelegant phrase waving the bloody
shirt the republicans refused to surrender a slogan which made such a
ready popular appeal as late as  a leader expressed the hope that
they might wring one more president from the bloody shirt they
refused to let the country forget that the democratic candidate grover
cleveland had escaped military service by hiring a substitute and they
made political capital out of the fact that he had insulted the
veterans of the grand army of the republic by going fishing on
decoration day

three republican presidentsfortified by all these elements of
strength the republicans held the presidency from  to  the
three presidents elected in this period grant hayes and garfield had
certain striking characteristics in common they were all of origin
humble enough to please the most exacting jacksonian democrat they had
been generals in the union army grant next to lincoln was regarded as
the savior of the constitution hayes and garfield though lesser lights
in the military firmament had honorable records duly appreciated by
veterans of the war now thoroughly organized into the grand army of the
republic it is true that grant was not a politician and had never voted
the republican ticket but this was readily overlooked hayes and
garfield on the other hand were loyal party men the former had served
in congress and for three terms as governor of his state the latter had
long been a member of the house of representatives and was senatorelect
when he received the nomination for president

all of them possessed moreover another important asset which was not
forgotten by the astute managers who led in selecting candidates all
of them were from ohiothough grant had been in illinois when the
summons to military duties cameand ohio was a strategic state it lay
between the manufacturing east and the agrarian country to the west
having growing industries and wool to sell it benefited from the
protective tariff yet being mainly agricultural still it was not

without sympathy for the farmers who showed low tariff or free trade
tendencies whatever share the east had in shaping laws and framing
policies it was clear that the west was to have the candidates this
division in privilegesnot uncommon in political managementwas always
accompanied by a judicious selection of the candidate for vice
president with garfield for example was associated a prominent new
york politician chester a arthur who as fate decreed was destined
to more than three years service as chief magistrate on the
assassination of his superior in office

the disputed election of while taking note of the long years of
republican supremacy it must be recorded that grave doubts exist in the
minds of many historians as to whether one of the three presidents
hayes was actually the victor in  or not his democratic opponent
samuel j tilden received a popular plurality of a quarter of a million
and had a plausible claim to a majority of the electoral vote at all
events four states sent in double returns one set for tilden and
another for hayes and a deadlock ensued both parties vehemently
claimed the election and the passions ran so high that sober men did not
shrink from speaking of civil war again fortunately in the end the
counsels of peace prevailed congress provided for an electoral
commission of fifteen men to review the contested returns the
democrats inspired by tildens moderation accepted the judgment in
favor of hayes even though they were not convinced that he was really
entitled to the office


the growth of opposition to republican rule

abuses in american political lifeduring their long tenure of
office the republicans could not escape the inevitable consequences of
power that is evil practices and corrupt conduct on the part of some
who found shelter within the party for that matter neither did the
democrats manage to avoid such difficulties in those states and cities
where they had the majority in new york city for instance the local
democratic organization known as tammany hall passed under the sway of
a group of politicians headed by boss tweed he plundered the city
treasury until publicspirited citizens supported by samuel j tilden
the democratic leader of the state rose in revolt drove the ringleader
from power and sent him to jail in philadelphia the local republican
bosses were guilty of offenses as odious as those committed by new york
politicians indeed the decade that followed the civil war was marred
by so many scandals in public life that one acute editor was moved to
inquire are not all the great communities of the western world growing
more corrupt as they grow in wealth

in the sphere of national politics where the opportunities were
greater betrayals of public trust were even more flagrant one
revelation after another showed officers high and low possessed with
the spirit of peculation members of congress it was found accepted
railway stock in exchange for votes in favor of land grants and other
concessions to the companies in the administration as well as the
legislature the disease was rife revenue officers permitted whisky
distillers to evade their taxes and received heavy bribes in return a
probe into the postoffice department revealed the malodorous star
route fraudsthe deliberate overpayment of certain mail carriers whose
lines were indicated in the official record by asterisks or stars even
cabinet officers did not escape suspicion for the trail of the serpent
led straight to the door of one of them

in the lower ranges of official life the spoils system became more
virulent as the number of federal employees increased the holders of
offices and the seekers after them constituted a veritable political
army they crowded into republican councils for the republicans being
in power could alone dispense federal favors they filled positions in
the party ranging from the lowest township committee to the national
convention they helped to nominate candidates and draft platforms and
elbowed to one side the busy citizen not conversant with party
intrigues who could only give an occasional day to political matters
even the civil service act of  wrung from a reluctant congress two
years after the assassination of garfield made little change for a long
time it took away from the spoilsmen a few thousand government
positions but it formed no check on the practice of rewarding party
workers from the public treasury

on viewing this state of affairs many a distinguished citizen became
profoundly discouraged james russell lowell for example thought he
saw a steady decline in public morals in  hearing of lees
surrender he had exclaimed there is something magnificent in having a
country to love ten years later when asked to write an ode for the
centennial at philadelphia in  he could think only of a biting
satire on the nation

    show your state legislatures show your rings
     and challenge europe to produce such things
     as high officials sitting half in sight
     to share the plunder and fix things right
     if that dont fetch her why you need only
     to show your latest style in martyrstweed
     shell find it hard to hide her spiteful tears
     at such advance in one poor hundred years

when his critics condemned him for this attack upon his native land
lowell replied in sadness these fellows have no notion of what love of
country means it was in my very blood and bones if i am not an
american who ever was what fills me with doubt and dismay is the
degradation of the moral tone is it or is it not a result of democracy
is ours a government of the people by the people for the people or
a kakistocracy a government of the worst rather for the benefit of
knaves at the cost of fools

the reform movement in republican ranksthe sentiments expressed by
lowell himself a republican and for a time american ambassador to
england were shared by many men in his party very soon after the close
of the civil war some of them began to protest vigorously against the
policies and conduct of their leaders in  the dissenters calling
themselves liberal republicans broke away altogether nominated a
candidate of their own horace greeley and put forward a platform
indicting the republican president fiercely enough to please the most
uncompromising democrat they accused grant of using the powers and
opportunities of his high office for the promotion of personal ends
they charged him with retaining notoriously corrupt and unworthy men in
places of power and responsibility they alleged that the republican
party kept alive the passions and resentments of the late civil war to
use them for their own advantages and employed the public service of
the government as a machinery of corruption and personal influence

it was not apparent however from the ensuing election that any
considerable number of republicans accepted the views of the liberals
greeley though indorsed by the democrats was utterly routed and died
of a broken heart the lesson of his discomfiture seemed to be that
independent action was futile so at least it was regarded by most men
of the rising generation like henry cabot lodge of massachusetts and
theodore roosevelt of new york profiting by the experience of greeley
they insisted in season and out that reformers who desired to rid the
party of abuses should remain loyal to it and do their work on the
inside

the mugwumps and cleveland democracy in though aided by
republican dissensions the democrats were slow in making headway
against the political current they were deprived of the energetic and
capable leadership once afforded by the planters like calhoun davis
and toombs they were saddled by their opponents with responsibility for
secession and they were stripped of the support of the prostrate
south not until the last southern state was restored to the union not
until a general amnesty was wrung from congress not until white
supremacy was established at the polls and the last federal soldier
withdrawn from southern capitals did they succeed in capturing the
presidency

the opportune moment for them came in  when a number of
circumstances favored their aspirations the republicans leaving the
ohio valley in their search for a candidate nominated james g blaine
of maine a vigorous and popular leader but a man under fire from the
reformers in his own party the democrats on their side were able to
find at this juncture an able candidate who had no political enemies in
the sphere of national politics grover cleveland then governor of new
york and widely celebrated as a man of sterling honesty at the same
time a number of dissatisfied republicans openly espoused the democratic
causeamong them carl schurz george william curtis henry ward
beecher and william everett men of fine ideals and undoubted
integrity though the regular republicans called them mugwumps and
laughed at them as the men milliners the dilettanti and carpet
knights of politics they had a following that was not to be despised

the campaign which took place that year was one of the most savage in
american history issues were thrust into the background the tariff
though mentioned was not taken seriously abuse of the opposition was
the favorite resource of party orators the democrats insisted that the
republican party so far as principle is concerned is a reminiscence in
practice it is an organization for enriching those who control its
machinery for the republican candidate blaine they could hardly find
words to express their contempt the republicans retaliated in kind
they praised their own good works as of old in saving the union and
denounced the fraud and violence practiced by the democracy in the
southern states seeing little objectionable in the public record of
cleveland as mayor of buffalo and governor of new york they attacked
his personal character perhaps never in the history of political
campaigns did the discussions on the platform and in the press sink to
so low a level decent people were sickened even hot partisans shrank
from their own words when after the election they had time to reflect
on their heedless passions moreover nothing was decided by the
balloting cleveland was elected but his victory was a narrow one a
change of a few hundred votes in new york would have sent his opponent
to the white house instead

changing political fortunes after the democrats had
settled down to the enjoyment of their hardearned victory president
cleveland in his message of  attacked the tariff as vicious
inequitable and illogical as a system of taxation that laid a burden
upon every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers
business enterprise was thoroughly alarmed the republicans
characterized the tariff message as a freetrade assault upon the
industries of the country mainly on that issue they elected in 
benjamin harrison of indiana a shrewd lawyer a reticent politician a
descendant of the hero of tippecanoe and a son of the old northwest
accepting the outcome of the election as a vindication of their
principles the republicans under the leadership of william mckinley in
the house of representatives enacted in  a tariff law imposing the
highest duties yet laid in our history to their utter surprise
however they were instantly informed by the country that their program
was not approved that very autumn they lost in the congressional
elections and two years later they were decisively beaten in the
presidential campaign cleveland once more leading his party to victory

the development of the great west


at the close of the civil war kansas and texas were sentinel states on
the middle border beyond the rockies california oregon and nevada
stood guard the last of them having been just admitted to furnish
another vote for the fifteenth amendment abolishing slavery between the
near and far frontiers lay a vast reach of plain desert plateau and
mountain almost wholly undeveloped a broad domain extending from
canada to mexico and embracing the regions now included in washington
idaho wyoming montana utah arizona new mexico the dakotas and
oklahoma had fewer than half a million inhabitants it was laid out
into territories each administered under a governor appointed by the
president and senate and as soon as there was the requisite number of
inhabitants a legislature elected by the voters no railway line
stretched across the desert st joseph on the missouri was the terminus
of the eastern lines it required twentyfive days for a passenger to
make the overland journey to california by the stagecoach system
established in  and more than ten days for the swift pony express
organized in  to carry a letter to san francisco indians still
roamed the plain and desert and more than one powerful tribe disputed
the white mans title to the soil


the railways as trail blazers

opening railways to the pacifica decade before the civil war the
importance of rail connection between the east and the pacific coast had
been recognized pressure had already been brought to bear on congress
to authorize the construction of a line and to grant land and money in
its aid both the democrats and republicans approved the idea but it
was involved in the slavery controversy indeed it was submerged in it
southern statesmen wanted connections between the gulf and the pacific
through texas while northerners stood out for a central route

the north had its way during the war congress by legislation initiated
in  provided for the immediate organization of companies to build a
line from the missouri river to california and made grants of land and
loans of money to aid in the enterprise the western end the central
pacific was laid out under the supervision of leland stanford it was
heavily financed by the mormons of utah and also by the state
government the ranchmen miners and business men of california and it
was built principally by chinese labor the eastern end the union
pacific starting at omaha was constructed mainly by veterans of the
civil war and immigrants from ireland and germany in  the two
companies met near ogden in utah and the driving of the last spike
uniting the atlantic and the pacific was the occasion of a great
demonstration

other lines to the pacific were projected at the same time but the
panic of  checked railway enterprise for a while with the revival
of prosperity at the end of that decade construction was renewed with
vigor and the year  marked a series of railway triumphs in february
trains were running from new orleans through houston san antonio and
yuma to san francisco as a result of a union of the texas pacific with
the southern pacific and its subsidiary corporations in september the
last spike was driven in the northern pacific at helena montana lake
superior was connected with puget sound the waters explored by joliet
and marquette were joined to the waters plowed by sir francis drake
while he was searching for a route around the world that same year also
a third line was opened to the pacific by way of the atchison topeka
and santa fe making connections through albuquerque and needles with
san francisco the fondest hopes of railway promoters seemed to be
realized

illustration united states in 

western railways precede settlementin the old world and on our
atlantic seaboard railways followed population and markets in the far
west railways usually preceded the people railway builders planned
cities on paper before they laid tracks connecting them they sent
missionaries to spread the gospel of western opportunity to people in
the middle west in the eastern cities and in southern states then
they carried their enthusiastic converts bag and baggage in long trains
to the distant dakotas and still farther afield so the development of
the far west was not left to the tedious processes of time it was
pushed by men of imaginationadventurers who made a romance of
moneymaking and who had dreams of empire unequaled by many kings of the
past

these empire builders bought railway lands in huge tracts they got more
from the government they overcame every obstacle of canon mountain
and stream with the aid of science they built cities according to the
plans made by the engineers having the towns ready and railway and
steamboat connections formed with the rest of the world they carried
out the people to use the railways the steamships the houses and the
land it was in this way that the frontier speculator paved the way for
the frontier agriculturalist who had to be near a market before he could
farm the spirit of this imaginative enterprise which laid out
railways and towns in advance of the people is seen in an advertisement
of that day this extension will run  miles from york northeast
through the island lake country and will have five good north dakota
towns the stations on the line will be well equipped with elevators and
will be constructed and ready for operation at the commencement of the
grain season prospective merchants have been active in securing
desirable locations at the different towns on the line there are still
opportunities for hotels general merchandise hardware furniture and
drug stores etc

a town on the prairie

among the railway promoters and builders in the west james j hill
of the great northern and allied lines was one of the most forceful
figures he knew that tracks and trains were useless without passengers
and freight without a population of farmers and town dwellers he
therefore organized publicity in the virginias iowa ohio indiana
illinois wisconsin and nebraska especially he sent out agents to tell
the story of western opportunity in this vein you see your children
come out of school with no chance to get farms of their own because the
cost of land in your older part of the country is so high that you cant
afford to buy land to start your sons out in life around you they have
to go to the cities to make a living or become laborers in the mills or
hire out as farm hands there is no future for them there if you are
doing well where you are and can safeguard the future of your children
and see them prosper around you dont leave here but if you want
independence if you are renting your land if the moneylender is
carrying you along and you are running behind year after year you can
do no worse by moving you farmers talk of free trade and protection
and what this or that political party will do for you why dont you
vote a homestead for yourself that is the only thing uncle sam will
ever give you jim hill hasnt an acre of land to sell you we are not
in the real estate business we dont want you to go out west and make a
failure of it because the rates at which we haul you and your goods make
the first transaction a loss we must have landless men for a manless
land

unlike steamship companies stimulating immigration to get the fares
hill was seeking permanent settlers who would produce manufacture and
use the railways as the means of exchange consequently he fixed low
rates and let his passengers take a good deal of live stock and
household furniture free by doing this he made an appeal that was
answered by eager families in  the vanguard of home seekers left
indiana in fourteen passenger coaches filled with men women and
children and fortyeight freight cars carrying their household goods
and live stock in the ten years that followed  people from the
middle west and the south responding to his call went to the western
country where they brought eight million acres of prairie land under
cultivation

when hill got his people on the land he took an interest in everything
that increased the productivity of their labor was the output of food
for his freight cars limited by bad drainage on the farms hill then
interested himself in practical ways of ditching and tiling were
farmers hampered in hauling their goods to his trains by bad roads in
that case he urged upon the states the improvement of highways did the
traffic slacken because the food shipped was not of the best quality
then live stock must be improved and scientific farming promoted did
the farmers need credit banks must be established close at hand to
advance it in all conferences on scientific farm management
conservation of natural resources banking and credit in relation to
agriculture and industry hill was an active participant his was the
long vision seeing in conservation and permanent improvements the
foundation of prosperity for the railways and the people

indeed he neglected no opportunity to increase the traffic on the
lines he wanted no empty cars running in either direction and no wheat
stored in warehouses for the lack of markets so he looked to the orient
as well as to europe as an outlet for the surplus of the farms he sent
agents to china and japan to discover what american goods and produce
those countries would consume and what manufactures they had to offer to
americans in exchange to open the pacific trade he bought two ocean
monsters the minnesota and the dakota thus preparing for
emergencies west as well as east when some japanese came to the united
states on their way to europe to buy steel rails hill showed them how
easy it was for them to make their purchase in this country and ship by
way of american railways and american vessels so the railway builder
and promoter who helped to break the virgin soil of the prairies lived
through the pioneer epoch and into the age of great finance before he
died he saw the wheat fields of north dakota linked with the spinning
jennies of manchester and the docks of yokohama


the evolution of grazing and agriculture

the removal of the indiansunlike the frontier of new england in
colonial days or that of kentucky later the advancing lines of home
builders in the far west had little difficulty with warlike natives
indian attacks were made on the railway construction gangs general
custer had his fatal battle with the sioux in  and there were minor
brushes but they were all of relatively slight consequence the former
practice of treating with the indians as independent nations was
abandoned in  and most of them were concentrated in reservations
where they were mainly supported by the government the supervision of
their affairs was vested in a board of commissioners created in  and
instructed to treat them as wards of the nationa trust which
unfortunately was often betrayed a further step in indian policy was
taken in  when provision was made for issuing lands to individual
indians thus permitting them to become citizens and settle down among
their white neighbors as farmers or cattle raisers the disappearance of
the buffalo the main food supply of the wild indians had made them
more tractable and more willing to surrender the freedom of the hunter
for the routine of the reservation ranch or wheat field

the cowboy and cattle rangerbetween the frontier of farms and the
mountains were plains and semiarid regions in vast reaches suitable for
grazing as soon as the railways were open into the missouri valley
affording an outlet for stock there sprang up to the westward cattle
and sheep raising on an immense scale the farfamed american cowboy was
the hero in this scene great herds of cattle were bred in texas with
the advancing spring and summer seasons they were driven northward
across the plains and over the buffalo trails in a single year 
it is estimated that nearly one million head of cattle were moved out of
texas to the north by four thousand cowboys supplied with 
horses and ponies

during the two decades from  to  both the cattle men and the
sheep raisers had an almost free run of the plains using public lands
without paying for the privilege and waging war on one another over the
possession of ranges at length however both had to go as the
homesteaders and land companies came and fenced in the plain and desert
with endless lines of barbed wire already in  a writer familiar
with the frontier lamented the passing of the picturesque days the
unique position of the cowboys among the americans is jeopardized in a
thousand ways towns are growing up on their pasture lands irrigation
schemes of a dozen sorts threaten to turn bunchgrass scenery into
farmland views farmers are preempting valleys and the sides of
waterways and the day is not far distant when stockraising must be
done mainly in small herds with winter corrals and then the cowboys
days will end even now his condition disappoints those who knew him
only half a dozen years ago his breed seems to have deteriorated and
his ranks are filling with men who work for wages rather than for the
love of the free life and bold companionship that once tempted men into
that calling splendid cheyenne saddles are less and less numerous in
the outfits the distinctive hat that made its way up from mexico may or
may not be worn all the civil authorities in nearly all towns in the
grazing country forbid the wearing of side arms nobody shoots up these
towns any more the fact is the old simonpure cowboy days are gone
already

settlement under the homestead act of two factors gave a
special stimulus to the rapid settlement of western lands which swept
away the indians and the cattle rangers the first was the policy of the
railway companies in selling large blocks of land received from the
government at low prices to induce immigration the second was the
operation of the homestead law passed in  this measure practically
closed the long controversy over the disposition of the public domain
that was suitable for agriculture it provided for granting without any
cost save a small registration fee public lands in lots of  acres
each to citizens and aliens who declared their intention of becoming
citizens the one important condition attached was that the settler
should occupy the farm for five years before his title was finally
confirmed even this stipulation was waived in the case of the civil war
veterans who were allowed to count their term of military service as a
part of the five years occupancy required as the soldiers of the
revolutionary and mexican wars had advanced in great numbers to the
frontier in earlier days so now veterans led in the settlement of the
middle border along with them went thousands of german irish and
scandinavian immigrants fresh from the old world between  and
  acres were staked out in quartersection farms in
twenty years  the population of nebraska leaped from  to
almost half a million kansas from  to a million iowa from
 to  and the dakotas from  to 

the diversity of western agriculturein soil produce and
management western agriculture presented many contrasts to that of the
east and south in the region of arable and watered lands the typical
american unitthe small farm tilled by the ownerappeared as usual
but by the side of it many a huge domain owned by foreign or eastern
companies and tilled by hired labor sometimes the great estate took the
shape of the bonanza farm devoted mainly to wheat and corn and
cultivated on a large scale by machinery again it assumed the form of
the cattle ranch embracing tens of thousands of acres again it was a
vast holding of diversified interest such as the santa anita ranch near
los angeles a domain of  acres cultivated in a glorious sweep of
vineyards and orange and olive orchards rich sheep and cattle pastures
and horse ranches their life and customs handed down from the spanish
owners of the various ranches which were swept into one estate

irrigationin one respect agriculture in the far west was unique in
a large area spreading through eight states montana idaho wyoming
utah colorado nevada arizona new mexico and parts of adjoining
states the rainfall was so slight that the ordinary crops to which the
american farmer was accustomed could not be grown at all the mormons
were the first anglosaxons to encounter aridity and they were baffled
at first but they studied it and mastered it by magnificent irrigation
systems as other settlers poured into the west the problem of the
desert was attacked with a will some of them replying to the
commiseration of eastern farmers by saying that it was easier to scoop
out an irrigation ditch than to cut forests and wrestle with stumps and
stones private companies bought immense areas at low prices built
irrigation works and disposed of their lands in small plots some
ranchers with an instinct for water like that of the miner for metal
sank wells into the dry sand and were rewarded with gushers that soused
the thirsty desert and turned its goodfornothing sand into
goodforanything loam the federal government came to the aid of the
arid regions in  by granting lands to the states to be used for
irrigation purposes in this work wyoming took the lead with a law which
induced capitalists to invest in irrigation and at the same time
provided for the sale of the redeemed lands to actual settlers finally
in  the federal government by its liberal reclamation act added its
strength to that of individuals companies and states in conquering
arid america

nowhere writes powell a historian of the west in his picturesque
end of the trail has the white man fought a more courageous fight or
won a more brilliant victory than in arizona his weapons have been the
transit and the level the drill and the dredge the pick and the spade
and the enemy which he has conquered has been the most stubborn of all
foesthe hostile forces of nature the story of how the white man
within the space of less than thirty years penetrated explored and
mapped this almost unknown region of how he carried law order and
justice into a section which had never had so much as a speaking
acquaintance with any one of the three before of how realizing the
necessity for means of communication he built highways of steel across
this territory from east to west and from north to south of how
undismayed by the savageness of the countenance which the desert turned
upon him he laughed and rolled up his sleeves and spat upon his hands
and slashed the face of the desert with canals and irrigating ditches
and filled those ditches with water brought from deep in the earth or
high in the mountains and of how in the conquered and submissive soil
he replaced the aloe with alfalfa the mesquite with maize the cactus
with cotton forms one of the most inspiring chapters in our history it
is one of the epics of civilization this reclamation of the southwest
and its heroes thank god are americans

other desert regions have been redeemed by irrigationegypt for
example and mesopotamia and parts of the sudanbut the people of all
those regions lay stretched out in the shade of a convenient palm
metaphorically speaking and waited for some one with more energy than
themselves to come along and do the work but the arizonians mindful of
the fact that god the government and carnegie help those who help
themselves spent their days wielding the pick and shovel and their
evenings in writing letters to washington with toilhardened hands
after a time the government was prodded into action and the great dams
at laguna and roosevelt are the result then the people organizing
themselves into cooperative leagues and waterusers associations took
up the work of reclamation where the government left off it is to these
energetic persevering men who have drilled wells plowed fields and
dug ditches through the length and breadth of that great region which
stretches from yuma to tucson that the metamorphosis of arizona is
due

the effect of irrigation wherever introduced was amazing stretches of
sand and sagebrush gave way to fertile fields bearing crops of wheat
corn fruits vegetables and grass huge ranches grazed by browsing
sheep were broken up into small plots the cowboy and ranchman vanished
in their place rose the prosperous communitya community unlike the
township of iowa or the industrial center of the east its intensive
tillage left little room for hired labor its small holdings drew
families together in village life rather than dispersing them on the
lonely plain often the development of water power in connection with
irrigation afforded electricity for laborsaving devices and lifted many
a burden that in other days fell heavily upon the shoulders of the
farmer and his family


mining and manufacturing in the west

mineral resourcesin another important particular the far west
differed from the mississippi valley states that was in the
predominance of mining over agriculture throughout a vast section
indeed it was the minerals rather than the land that attracted the
pioneers who first opened the country the discovery of gold in
california in  was the signal for the great rush of prospectors
miners and promoters who explored the valleys climbed the hills
washed the sands and dug up the soil in their feverish search for gold
silver copper coal and other minerals in nevada and montana the
development of mineral resources went on all during the civil war alder
gulch became virginia city in  last chance gulch was named helena
in  and confederate gulch was christened diamond city in  at
butte the miners began operations in  and within five years had
washed out eight million dollars worth of gold under the gold they
found silver under silver they found copper

even at the end of the nineteenth century after agriculture was well
advanced and stock and sheep raising introduced on a large scale
minerals continued to be the chief source of wealth in a number of
states this was revealed by the figures for  the gold silver
iron and copper of colorado were worth more than the wheat corn and
oats combined the copper of montana sold for more than all the cereals

timber resourcesthe forests of the great west unlike those of the
ohio valley proved a boon to the pioneers rather than a foe to be
attacked in ohio and indiana for example the frontier line of
homemakers had to cut roll and burn thousands of trees before they
could put out a crop of any size beyond the mississippi however
there were all ready for the breaking plow great reaches of almost
treeless prairie where every stick of timber was precious in the other
parts often rough and mountainous where stood primeval forests of the
finest woods the railroads made good use of the timber they consumed
acres of forests themselves in making ties bridge timbers and
telegraph poles and they laid a heavy tribute upon the forests for
their annual upkeep the surplus trees such as had burdened the
pioneers of the northwest territory a hundred years before they carried
off to markets on the east and west coasts

western industriesthe peculiar conditions of the far west
stimulated a rise of industries more rapid than is usual in new country
the mining activities which in many sections preceded agriculture called
for sawmills to furnish timber for the mines and smelters to reduce and
refine ores the ranches supplied sheep and cattle for the packing
houses of kansas city as well as chicago the waters of the northwest
afforded salmon for  cases in  and for  cases in 
the fruits and vegetables of california brought into existence
innumerable canneries the lumber industry starting with crude sawmills
to furnish rough timbers for railways and mines ended in specialized
factories for paper boxes and furniture as the railways preceded
settlement and furnished a ready outlet for local manufactures so they
encouraged the early establishment of varied industries thus creating a
state of affairs quite unlike that which obtained in the ohio valley in
the early days before the opening of the erie canal

social effects of economic activitiesin many respects the social
life of the far west also differed from that of the ohio valley the
treeless prairies though open to homesteads favored the great estate
tilled in part by tenant labor and in part by migratory seasonal labor
summoned from all sections of the country for the harvests the mineral
resources created hundreds of huge fortunes which made the accumulations
of eastern mercantile families look trivial by comparison other
millionaires won their fortunes in the railway business and still more
from the cattle and sheep ranges in many sections the cattle king as
he was called was as dominant as the planter had been in the old south
everywhere in the grazing country he was a conspicuous and important
person he sometimes invested money in banks in railroad stocks or in
city property he had his rating in the commercial reviews and could
hobnob with bankers railroad presidents and metropolitan merchants
he attended party caucuses and conventions ran for the state
legislature and sometimes defeated a lawyer or metropolitan business
man in the race for a seat in congress in proportion to their numbers
the ranchers  have constituted a highly impressive class

although many of the early capitalists of the great west especially
from nevada spent their money principally in the east others took
leadership in promoting the sections in which they had made their
fortunes a railroad pioneer general palmer built his home at colorado
springs founded the town and encouraged local improvements denver
owed its first impressive buildings to the civic patriotism of horace
tabor a wealthy mine owner leland stanford paid his tribute to
california in the endowment of a large university colonel wf cody
better known as buffalo bill started his career by building a boom
town which collapsed and made a large sum of money supplying buffalo
meat to construction hands hence his popular name by his famous wild
west show he increased it to a fortune which he devoted mainly to the
promotion of a western reclamation scheme

while the far west was developing this vigorous aggressive leadership
in business a considerable industrial population was springing up even
the cattle ranges and hundreds of farms were conducted like factories in
that they were managed through overseers who hired plowmen harvesters
and cattlemen at regular wages at the same time there appeared other
peculiar features which made a lasting impression on western economic
life mining lumbering and fruit growing for instance employed
thousands of workers during the rush months and turned them out at other
times the inevitable result was an army of migratory laborers wandering
from camp to camp from town to town and from ranch to ranch without
fixed homes or established habits of life from this extraordinary
condition there issued many a long and lawless conflict between capital
and labor giving a distinct color to the labor movement in whole
sections of the mountain and coast states


the admission of new states

the spirit of selfgovernmentthe instinct of selfgovernment was
strong in the western communities in the very beginning it led to the
organization of volunteer committees known as vigilantes to suppress
crime and punish criminals as soon as enough people were settled
permanently in a region they took care to form a more stable kind of
government an illustration of this process is found in the oregon
compact made by the pioneers in  the spirit of which is reflected
in an editorial in an old copy of the rocky mountain news we claim
that any body or community of american citizens which from any cause or
under any circumstances is cut off from or from isolation is so situated
as not to be under any active and protecting branch of the central
government have a right if on american soil to frame a government and
enact such laws and regulations as may be necessary for their own
safety protection and happiness always with the condition precedent
that they shall at the earliest moment when the central government
shall extend an effective organization and laws over them give it their
unqualified support and obedience

people who turned so naturally to the organization of local
administration were equally eager for admission to the union as soon as
any shadow of a claim to statehood could be advanced as long as a
region was merely one of the territories of the united states the
appointment of the governor and other officers was controlled by
politics at washington moreover the disposition of land mineral
rights forests and water power was also in the hands of national
leaders thus practical considerations were united with the spirit of
independence in the quest for local autonomy

nebraska and coloradotwo states nebraska and colorado had little
difficulty in securing admission to the union the first nebraska had
been organized as a territory by the famous kansasnebraska bill which
did so much to precipitate the civil war lying to the north of kansas
which had been admitted in  it escaped the invasion of slave owners
from missouri and was settled mainly by farmers from the north though
it claimed a population of only  it was regarded with kindly
interest by the republican congress at washington and reduced to its
present boundaries it received the coveted statehood in 

this was hardly accomplished before the people of colorado to the
southwest began to make known their demands they had been organized
under territorial government in  when they numbered only a handful
but within ten years the aspect of their affairs had completely changed
the silver and gold deposits of the leadville and cripple creek regions
had attracted an army of miners and prospectors the city of denver
founded in  and named after the governor of kansas whence came many
of the early settlers had grown from a straggling camp of log huts into
a prosperous center of trade by  it was reckoned that the
population of the territory was not less than one hundred thousand the
following year congress yielding to the popular appeal made colorado a
member of the american union

six new states for many years there was a deadlock in
congress over the admission of new states the spell was broken in 
under the leadership of the dakotas for a long time the dakota
territory organized in  had been looked upon as the home of the
powerful sioux indians whose enormous reservation blocked the advance of
the frontier the discovery of gold in the black hills however marked
their doom even before congress could open their lands to prospectors
pioneers were swarming over the country farmers from the adjoining
minnesota and the eastern states scandinavians germans and canadians
came in swelling waves to occupy the fertile dakota lands now famous
even as far away as the fjords of norway seldom had the plow of man cut
through richer soil than was found in the bottoms of the red river
valley and it became all the more precious when the opening of the
northern pacific in  afforded a means of transportation east and
west the population which had numbered  in  passed the
half million mark before ten years had elapsed

remembering that nebraska had been admitted with only 
inhabitants the dakotans could not see why they should be kept under
federal tutelage at the same time washington far away on the pacific
coast montana idaho and wyoming boasting of their populations and
their riches put in their own eloquent pleas but the members of
congress were busy with politics the democrats saw no good reason for
admitting new republican states until after their defeat in  near
the end of their term the next year they opened the door for north and
south dakota washington and montana in  a republican congress
brought idaho and wyoming into the union the latter with woman
suffrage which had been granted twentyone years before

utahalthough utah had long presented all the elements of a
wellsettled and industrious community its admission to the union was
delayed on account of popular hostility to the practice of polygamy the
custom it is true had been prohibited by act of congress in  but
the law had been systematically evaded in  congress made another
and more effective effort to stamp out polygamy five years later it
even went so far as to authorize the confiscation of the property of the
mormon church in case the practice of plural marriages was not stopped
meanwhile the gentile or nonmormon population was steadily increasing
and the leaders in the church became convinced that the battle
against the sentiment of the country was futile at last in  utah
was admitted as a state under a constitution which forbade plural
marriages absolutely and forever horace greeley who visited utah in
 had prophesied that the pacific railroad would work a revolution
in the land of brigham young his prophecy had come true

half a million to the west arizona with a population of about

statehood congress then republican looked with reluctance upon the
addition of more democratic states but in  it was literally
compelled by public sentiment and a sense of justice to admit oklahoma
in  the house of representatives went to the democrats and within
two years arizona and new mexico were under the roof so the
continental domain was rounded out

within thirty years travelers were riding across that country in pullman
cars and enjoying at the hotels all the comforts of a standardized
civilization the wild west was gone and with it that frontier of
pioneers and settlers who had long given such a bent and tone to
american life and had poured in upon the floor of congress such a long
line of backwoods politicians as they were scornfully styled

free land and eastern laborit was not only the picturesque features
of the frontier that were gone of far more consequence was the
disappearance of free lands with all that meant for american labor for
more than a hundred years any man of even moderate means had been able
to secure a homestead of his own and an independent livelihood for a
hundred years america had been able to supply farms to as many
immigrants as cared to till the soil every new pair of strong arms
meant more farms and more wealth workmen in eastern factories mines
or mills who did not like their hours wages or conditions of labor
could readily find an outlet to the land now all that was over by
about  most of the desirable land available under the homestead act
had disappeared american industrial workers confronted a new situation

grain supplants king cottonin the meantime a revolution was taking
place in agriculture until  the chief staples sold by america were
cotton and tobacco with the advance of the frontier corn and wheat
supplanted them both in agrarian economy the west became the granary of
the east and of western europe the scoop shovel once used to handle
grain was superseded by the towering elevator loading and unloading
thousands of bushels every hour the refrigerator car and ship made the
packing industry as stable as the production of cotton or corn and gave
an immense impetus to cattle raising and sheep farming so the meat of
the west took its place on the english dinner table by the side of bread
baked from dakotan wheat

aid in american economic independencethe effects of this economic
movement were manifold and striking billions of dollars worth of
american grain dairy produce and meat were poured into european
markets where they paid off debts due money lenders and acquired
capital to develop american resources thus they accelerated the
progress of american financiers toward national independence the
country which had timidly turned to the old world for capital in
hamiltons day and had borrowed at high rates of interest in london in
lincolns day moved swiftly toward the time when it would be among the
worlds first bankers and money lenders itself every grain of wheat and
corn pulled the balance down on the american side of the scale

eastern agriculture affectedin the east as well as abroad the
opening of the western granary produced momentous results the
agricultural economy of that part of the country was changed in many
respects whole sections of the poorest land went almost out of
cultivation the abandoned farms of the new england hills bearing solemn
witness to the competing power of western wheat fields sheep and cattle
raising as well as wheat and corn production suffered at least a
relative decline thousands of farmers cultivating land of the lower
grade were forced to go west or were driven to the margin of
subsistence even the herds that supplied eastern cities with milk were
fed upon grain brought halfway across the continent

the expansion of the american marketupon industry as well as
agriculture the opening of vast foodproducing regions told in a
thousand ways the demand for farm machinery clothing boots shoes
and other manufactures gave to american industries such a market as even
hamilton had never foreseen moreover it helped to expand far into the
mississippi valley the industrial area once confined to the northern
seaboard states and to transform the region of the great lakes into an
industrial empire herein lies the explanation of the growth of
midwestern cities after  chicago with its thirtyfive railways
tapped every locality of the west and south to the railways were added
the water routes of the lakes thus creating a strategic center for
industries long foresight carried the mccormick reaper works to
chicago before  from troy new york went a large stove plant that
was followed by a shoe factory from massachusetts the packing industry
rose as a matter of course at a point so advantageous for cattle raisers
and shippers and so well connected with eastern markets

to the opening of the far west also the lake region was indebted for a
large part of that waterborne traffic which made it the mediterranean
basin of north america the produce of the west and the manufactures of
the east poured through it in an endless stream the swift growth of
shipbuilding on the great lakes helped to compensate for the decline of
the american marine on the high seas in response to this stimulus
detroit could boast that her shipwrights were able to turn out a ten
thousand ton leviathan for ore or grain about as quickly as carpenters
could put up an eightroom house thus in relation to the far west the
old northwest territorythe wilderness of jeffersons timehad taken
the position formerly occupied by new england alone it was supplying
capital and manufactures for a vast agricultural empire west and south

america on the pacificit has been said that the mediterranean sea
was the center of ancient civilization that modern civilization has
developed on the shores of the atlantic and that the future belongs to
the pacific at any rate the sweep of the united states to the shores
of the pacific quickly exercised a powerful influence on world affairs
and it undoubtedly has a still greater significance for the future

very early regular traffic sprang up between the pacific ports and the
hawaiian islands china and japan two years before the adjustment of
the oregon controversy with england namely in  the united states
had established official and trading relations with china ten years
later four years after the admission of california to the union the
barred door of japan was forced open by commodore perry the commerce
which had long before developed between the pacific ports and hawaii
china and japan now flourished under official care in  a ship
from honolulu carried sugar molasses and fruits from hawaii to the
oregon port of astoria the next year a vessel from hongkong brought
rice mats and tea from china an era of lucrative trade was opened
the annexation of hawaii in  the addition of the philippines at the
same time and the participation of american troops in the suppression
of the boxer rebellion in peking in  were but signs and symbols of
american power on the pacific

conservation and the land problemthe disappearance of the frontier
also brought new and serious problems to the governments of the states
and the nation the people of the whole united states suddenly were
forced to realize that there was a limit to the rich new land to
exploit and to the forests and minerals awaiting the ax and the pick
then arose in america the questions which had long perplexed the
countries of the old worldthe scientific use of the soils and
conservation of natural resources hitherto the government had followed
the easy path of giving away arable land and selling forest and mineral
lands at low prices now it had to face far more difficult and complex
problems it also had to consider questions of land tenure again
especially if the ideal of a nation of homeowning farmers was to be
maintained while there was plenty of land for every man or woman who
wanted a home on the soil it made little difference if single landlords
or companies got possession of millions of acres if a hundred men in
one western river valley owned  acres but when the good land
for small homesteads was all gone then was raised the real issue at
the opening of the twentieth century the nation which a hundred years
before had land and natural resources apparently without limit was
compelled to enact law after law conserving its forests and minerals
then it was that the great state of california on the very border of
the continent felt constrained to enact a land settlement measure
providing government assistance in an effort to break up large holdings
into small lots and to make it easy for actual settlers to acquire small
farms america was passing into a new epoch

chapter xix

domestic issues before the country 


for thirty years after the civil war the leading political parties
although they engaged in heated presidential campaigns were not sharply
and clearly opposed on many matters of vital significance during none
of that time was there a clash of opinion over specific issues such as
rent the country in  when jefferson rode a popular wave to victory
or again in  when jacksons western hordes came sweeping into power
the democrats who before  definitely opposed protective tariffs
federal banking internal improvements and heavy taxes now spoke
cautiously on all these points the republicans conscious of the fact
that they had been a minority of the voters in  and warned by the
early loss of the house of representatives in  also moved with
considerable prudence among the perplexing problems of the day again
and again the votes in congress showed that no clear line separated all
the democrats from all the republicans there were republicans who
favored tariff reductions and cheap money there were democrats who
looked with partiality upon high protection or with indulgence upon the
contraction of the currency only on matters relating to the coercion of
the south was the division between the parties fairly definite this
could be readily accounted for on practical as well as sentimental
grounds

after all the vague criticisms and proposals that found their way into
the political platforms did but reflect the confusion of mind prevailing
in the country the fact that out of the eighteen years between 
and  the democrats held the house of representatives for fourteen
years while the republicans had every president but one showed that the
voters like the politicians were in a state of indecision hayes had a
democratic house during his entire term and a democratic senate for two
years of the four cleveland was confronted by a belligerent republican
majority in the senate during his first administration and at the same
time was supported by a democratic majority in the house harrison was
sustained by continuous republican successes in senatorial elections
but in the house he had the barest majority from  to  and lost
that altogether at the election held in the middle of his term the
opinion of the country was evidently unsettled and fluctuating it was
still distracted by memories of the dead past and uncertain as to the
trend of the future


the currency question

nevertheless these years of muddled politics and nebulous issues proved
to be a period in which social forces were gathering for the great
campaign of  except for three new featuresthe railways the
trusts and the trade unionsthe subjects of debate among the people
were the same as those that had engaged their attention since the
foundation of the republic the currency the national debt banking
the tariff and taxation

debtors and the fall in pricesfor many reasons the currency
question occupied the center of interest as of old the farmers and
planters of the west and south were heavily in debt to the east for
borrowed money secured by farm mortgages and they counted upon the sale
of cotton corn wheat and hogs to meet interest and principal when
due during the war the western farmers had been able to dispose of
their produce at high prices and thus discharge their debts with
comparative ease but after the war prices declined wheat that sold at
two dollars a bushel in  brought sixtyfour cents twenty years
later the meaning of this for the farmers in debtand nearly
threefourths of them were in that classcan be shown by a single
illustration a thousanddollar mortgage on a western farm could be paid
off by five hundred bushels of wheat when prices were high whereas it
took about fifteen hundred bushels to pay the same debt when wheat was
at the bottom of the scale for the farmer it must be remembered wheat
was the measure of his labor the product of his toil under the summer
sun and in its price he found the test of his prosperity

creditors and falling pricesto the bondholders or creditors on the
other hand falling prices were clear gain if a fiftydollar coupon on
a bond bought seventy or eighty bushels of wheat instead of twenty or
thirty the advantage to the owner of the coupon was obvious moreover
the advantage seemed to him entirely just creditors had suffered heavy
losses when the civil war carried prices skyward while the interest
rates on their old bonds remained stationary for example if a man had
a  bond issued before  and paying interest at five per cent he
received fifty dollars a year from it before the war each dollar would
buy a bushel of wheat in  it would only buy half a bushel when
pricesthat is the cost of livingbegan to go down creditors
therefore generally regarded the change with satisfaction as a return to
normal conditions

the cause of falling pricesthe fall in prices was due no doubt to
many factors among them must be reckoned the discontinuance of
government buying for war purposes laborsaving farm machinery
immigration and the opening of new wheatgrowing regions the currency
too was an element in the situation whatever the cause the
discontented farmers believed that the way to raise prices was to issue
more money they viewed it as a case of supply and demand if there was
a small volume of currency in circulation prices would be low if there
was a large volume prices would be high hence they looked with favor
upon all plans to increase the amount of money in circulation first
they advocated more paper notesgreenbacksand then they turned to
silver as the remedy the creditors on the other hand naturally
approved the reduction of the volume of currency they wished to see the
greenbacks withdrawn from circulation and golda metal more limited in
volume than silvermade the sole basis of the national monetary system

the battle over the greenbacksthe contest between these factions
began as early as  in that year congress enacted a law authorizing
the treasury to withdraw the greenbacks from circulation the paper
money party set up a shrill cry of protest and kept up the fight until
in  it forced congress to provide for the continuous reissue of
the legal tender notes as they came into the treasury in payment of
taxes and other dues then could the friends of easy money rejoice

    thou greenback tis of thee
     fair money of the free
      of thee we sing

resumption of specie paymentthere was however another side to
this victory the opponents of the greenbacks unable to stop the
circulation of paper induced congress to pass a law in  providing
that on and after january   the secretary of the treasury shall
redeem in coin the united states legal tender notes then outstanding on
their presentation at the office of the assistant treasurer of the
united states in the city of new york in sums of not less than fifty
dollars the way to resume john sherman had said is to resume
when the hour for redemption arrived the treasury was prepared with a
large hoard of gold on the appointed day wrote the assistant
secretary anxiety reigned in the office of the treasury hour after
hour passed no news from new york inquiry by wire showed that all was
quiet at the close of the day this message came  of notes
presented for coin of gold for notes that was all
resumption was accomplished with no disturbance by five oclock the
news was all over the land and the new york bankers were sipping their
tea in absolute safety

the specie problemthe parity of gold and silverdefeated in their
efforts to stop the present suicidal and destructive policy of
contraction the advocates of an abundant currency demanded an increase
in the volume of silver in circulation this precipitated one of the
sharpest political battles in american history the issue turned on
legal as well as economic points the constitution gave congress the
power to coin money and it forbade the states to make anything but gold
and silver legal tender in the payment of debts it evidently
contemplated the use of both metals in the currency system such at
least was the view of many eminent statesmen including no less a
personage than james g blaine the difficulty however lay in
maintaining gold and silver coins on a level which would permit them to
circulate with equal facility obviously if the gold in a gold dollar
exceeds the value of the silver in a silver dollar on the open market
men will hoard gold money and leave silver money in circulation when
for example congress in  fixed the ratio of the two metals at one
to fifteenone ounce of gold declared worth fifteen of silverit was
soon found that gold had been undervalued when again in  the ratio
was put at one to sixteen it was found that silver was undervalued
consequently the latter metal was not brought in for coinage and silver
almost dropped out of circulation many a silver dollar was melted down
by silverware factories

silver demonetized in so things stood in  at that time
congress in enacting a mintage law discontinued the coinage of the
standard silver dollar then practically out of circulation this act
was denounced later by the friends of silver as the crime of  a
conspiracy devised by the money power and secretly carried out this
contention the debates in congress do not seem to sustain in the course
of the argument on the mint law it was distinctly said by one speaker at
least this bill provides for the making of changes in the legal tender
coin of the country and for substituting as legal tender coin of only
one metal instead of two as heretofore

the decline in the value of silverabsorbed in the greenback
controversy the people apparently did not appreciate at the time the
significance of the demonetization of silver but within a few years
several events united in making it the center of a political storm
germany having abandoned silver in  steadily increased her demand
for gold three years later the countries of the latin union followed
this example thus helping to enhance the price of the yellow metal all
the while new silver lodes discovered in the far west were pouring
into the market great streams of the white metal bearing down the
price then came the resumption of specie payment which in effect
placed the paper money on a gold basis within twenty years silver was
worth in gold only about half the price of 

that there had been a real decline in silver was denied by the friends
of that metal they alleged that gold had gone up because it had been
given a monopoly in the coinage markets of civilized governments this
monopoly they continued was the fruit of a conspiracy against the
people conceived by the bankers of the world moreover they went on
the placing of the greenbacks on a gold basis had itself worked a
contraction of the currency it lowered the prices of labor and produce
to the advantage of the holders of longterm investments bearing a fixed
rate of interest when wheat sold at sixtyfour cents a bushel their
search for relief became desperate and they at last concentrated their
efforts on opening the mints of the government for the free coinage of
silver at the ratio of sixteen to one

republicans and democrats dividedon this question both republicans
and democrats were divided the line being drawn between the east on the
one hand and the south and west on the other rather than between the
two leading parties so trusted a leader as james g blaine avowed in a
speech delivered in the senate in  that as the constitution
required congress to make both gold and silver the money of the land
the only question left was that of fixing the ratio between them he
affirmed moreover the main contention of the silver faction that a
reopening of the government mints of the world to silver would bring it
up to its old relation with gold he admitted also that their most
ominous warnings were well founded saying i believe the struggle now
going on in this country and in other countries for a single gold
standard would if successful produce widespread disaster throughout
the commercial world the destruction of silver as money and the
establishment of gold as the sole unit of value must have a ruinous
effect on all forms of property except those investments which yield a
fixed return

this was exactly the concession that the silver party wanted
threefourths of the business enterprises of this country are conducted
on borrowed capital said senator jones of nevada threefourths of
the homes and farms that stand in the names of the actual occupants have
been bought on time and a very large proportion of them are mortgaged
for the payment of some part of the purchase money under the operation
of a shrinkage in the volume of money this enormous mass of borrowers
at the maturity of their respective debts though nominally paying no
more than the amount borrowed with interest are in reality in the
amount of the principal alone returning a percentage of value greater
than they receivedmore in equity than they contracted to pay in
all discussions of the subject the creditors attempt to brush aside the
equities involved by sneering at the debtors

the silver purchase act even before the actual resumption of
specie payment the advocates of free silver were a power to be reckoned
with particularly in the democratic party they had a majority in the
house of representatives in  and they carried a silver bill through
that chamber blocked by the republican senate they accepted a
compromise in the blandallison bill which provided for huge monthly
purchases of silver by the government for coinage into dollars so
strong was the sentiment that a twothirds majority was mustered after
president hayes vetoed the measure

the effect of this act as some had anticipated was disappointing it
did not stay silver on its downward course thereupon the silver faction
pressed through congress in  a bill providing for the issue of paper
certificates based on the silver accumulated in the treasury still
silver continued to fall then the advocates of inflation declared that
they would be content with nothing short of free coinage at the ratio of
sixteen to one if the issue had been squarely presented in  there
is good reason for believing that free silver would have received a
majority in both houses of congress but it was not presented

the sherman silver purchase act and the bond salesrepublican
leaders particularly from the east stemmed the silver tide by a
diversion of forces they passed the sherman act of  providing for
large monthly purchases of silver and for the issue of notes redeemable
in gold or silver at the discretion of the secretary of the treasury in
a clause of superb ambiguity they announced that it was the established
policy of the united states to maintain the two metals on a parity with
each other upon the present legal ratio or such other ratio as may be
provided by law for a while silver was buoyed up then it turned once
more on its downward course in the meantime the treasury was in a sad
plight to maintain the gold reserve president cleveland felt compelled
to sell government bonds and to his dismay he found that as soon as the
gold was brought in at the front door of the treasury notes were
presented for redemption and the gold was quickly carried out at the
back door alarmed at the vicious circle thus created he urged upon
congress the repeal of the sherman silver purchase act for this he was
roundly condemned by many of his own followers who branded his conduct
as treason to the party but the republicans especially from the
east came to his rescue and in  swept the troublesome sections of
the law from the statute book the anger of the silver faction knew no
bounds and the leaders made ready for the approaching presidential
campaign


the protective tariff and taxation

fluctuation in tariff policyas each of the old parties was divided
on the currency question it is not surprising that there was some
confusion in their ranks over the tariff like the silver issue the
tariff tended to align the manufacturing east against the agricultural
west and south rather than to cut directly between the two parties
still the republicans on the whole stood firmly by the rates imposed
during the civil war if we except the reductions of  which were
soon offset by increases we may say that those rates were substantially
unchanged for nearly twenty years when a revision was brought about
however it was initiated by republican leaders seeing a huge surplus
of revenue in the treasury in  they anticipated popular clamor by
revising the tariff on the theory that it ought to be reformed by its
friends rather than by its enemies on the other hand it was the
republicans also who enacted the mckinley tariff bill of  which
carried protection to its highest point up to that time

the democrats on their part were not all confirmed free traders or even
advocates of tariff for revenue only in clevelands first
administration they did attack the protective system in the house where
they had a majority and in this they were vigorously supported by the
president the assault however proved to be a futile gesture for it
was blocked by the republicans in the senate when after the sweeping
victory of  the democrats in the house again attempted to bring
down the tariff by the wilson bill of  they were checkmated by
their own party colleagues in the upper chamber in the end they were
driven into a compromise that looked more like a mckinley than a calhoun
tariff the republicans taunted them with being babes in the woods
president cleveland was so dissatisfied with the bill that he refused to
sign it allowing it to become a law on the lapse of ten days without
his approval

the income tax of the advocates of tariff reduction usually
associated with their proposal a tax on incomes the argument which
they advanced in support of their program was simple most of the
industries they said are in the east and the protective tariff which
taxes consumers for the benefit of manufacturers is in effect a
tribute laid upon the rest of the country as an offset they offered a
tax on large incomes this owing to the heavy concentration of rich
people in the east would fall mainly upon the beneficiaries of
protection we propose said one of them to place a part of the
burden upon the accumulated wealth of the country instead of placing it
all upon the consumption of the people in this spirit the sponsors of
the wilson tariff bill laid a tax upon all incomes of  a year or
more

in taking this step the democrats encountered opposition in their own
party senator hill of new york turned fiercely upon them exclaiming
the professors with their books the socialists with their schemes the
anarchists with their bombs are all instructing the people in the 
principles of taxation even the eastern republicans were hardly as
savage in their denunciation of the tax but all this labor was wasted
the next year the supreme court of the united states declared the income
tax to be a direct tax and therefore null and void because it was laid
on incomes wherever found and not apportioned among the states according
to population the fact that four of the nine judges dissented from this
decision was also an index to the diversity of opinion that divided both
parties


the railways and trusts

the grangers and state regulationthe same uncertainty about the
railways and trusts pervaded the ranks of the republicans and democrats
as to the railways the first firm and consistent demand for their
regulation came from the west there the farmers in the early
seventies having got control in state legislatures particularly in
iowa wisconsin and illinois enacted drastic laws prescribing the
maximum charges which companies could make for carrying freight and
passengers the application of these measures however was limited
because the state could not fix the rates for transporting goods and
passengers beyond its own borders the power of regulating interstate
commerce under the constitution belonged to congress

the interstate commerce act of within a few years the movement
which had been so effective in western legislatures appeared at
washington in the form of demands for the federal regulation of
interstate rates in  the pressure became so strong that congress
created the interstate commerce commission and forbade many abuses on
the part of railways such as discriminating in charges between one
shipper and another and granting secret rebates to favored persons this
law was a significant beginning but it left the main question of
ratefixing untouched much to the discontent of farmers and shippers

the sherman antitrust law of as in the case of the railways
attacks upon the trusts were first made in state legislatures where it
became the fashion to provide severe penalties for those who formed
monopolies and conspired to enhance prices republicans and democrats
united in the promotion of measures of this kind as in the case of the
railways also the movement to curb the trusts soon had spokesmen at
washington though blaine had declared that trusts were largely a
private affair with which neither the president nor any private citizen
had any particular right to interfere it was a republican congress
that enacted in  the first measurethe sherman antitrust
lawdirected against great combinations in business this act declared
illegal every contract combination in the form of trust or otherwise
or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among the several
states or with foreign nations

the futility of the antitrust lawwhether the sherman law was
directed against all combinations or merely those which placed an
unreasonable restraint on trade and competition was not apparent
senator platt of connecticut a careful statesman of the old school
averred the questions of whether the bill would be operative of how
it would operate or whether it was within the power of congress to
enact it have been whistled down the wind in this senate as idle talk
and the whole effort has been to get some bill headed a bill to punish
trusts with which to go to the country whatever its purpose its
effect upon existing trusts and upon the formation of new combinations
was negligible it was practically unenforced by president harrison and
president cleveland in spite of the constant demand for harsh action
against monopolies it was patent that neither the republicans nor the
democrats were prepared for a war on the trusts to the bitter end


the minor parties and unrest

the demands of dissenting partiesfrom the election of  when
horace greeley made his illfated excursion into politics onward there
appeared in each presidential campaign one and sometimes two or more
parties stressing issues that appealed mainly to wageearners and
farmers whether they chose to call themselves labor reformers
greenbackers or antimonopolists their slogans and their platforms all
pointed in one direction even the prohibitionists who in  started
on their career with a single issue the abolition of the liquor
traffic found themselves making declarations of faith on other matters
and hopelessly split over the money question in 

a composite view of the platforms put forth by the dissenting parties
from the administration of grant to the close of clevelands second term
reveals certain notions common to them all these included among many
others the earliest possible payment of the national debt regulation
of the rates of railways and telegraph companies repeal of the specie
resumption act of  the issue of legal tender notes by the
government convertible into interestbearing obligations on demand
unlimited coinage of silver as well as gold a graduated inheritance
tax legislation to take from land railroad money and other gigantic
corporate monopolies  the powers they have so corruptly and unjustly
usurped popular or direct election of united states senators woman
suffrage and a graduated income tax placing the burden of government
on those who can best afford to pay instead of laying it on the farmers
and producers

criticism of the old partiesto this long program of measures the
reformers added harsh and acrid criticism of the old parties and
sometimes it must be said of established institutions of government
we denounce exclaimed the labor party in  the democratic and
republican parties as hopelessly and shamelessly corrupt and by reason
of their affiliation with monopolies equally unworthy of the suffrages
of those who do not live upon public plunder the united states
senate insisted the greenbackers is a body composed largely of
aristocratic millionaires who according to their own party papers
generally purchased their elections in order to protect the great
monopolies which they represent indeed if their platforms are to be
accepted at face value the greenbackers believed that the entire
government had passed out of the hands of the people

the grangersthis unsparing not to say revolutionary criticism of
american political life appealed it seems mainly to farmers in the
middle west always active in politics they had before the civil war
cast their lot as a rule with one or the other of the leading parties
in  however there grew up among them an association known as the
patrons of husbandry which was destined to play a large role in the
partisan contests of the succeeding decades this society which
organized local lodges or granges on principles of secrecy and
fraternity was originally designed to promote in a general way the
interests of the farmers its political bearings were apparently not
grasped at first by its promoters yet appealing as it did to the most
active and independent spirits among the farmers and gathering to itself
the strength that always comes from organization it soon found itself
in the hands of leaders more or less involved in politics where a few
votes are marshaled together in a democracy there is power

the greenback partythe first extensive activity of the grangers was
connected with the attack on the railways in the middle west which
forced several state legislatures to reduce freight and passenger rates
by law at the same time some leaders in the movement no doubt
emboldened by this success launched in  a new political party
popularly known as the greenbackers favoring a continued reissue of
the legal tenders the beginnings were disappointing but two years
later in the congressional elections the greenbackers swept whole
sections of the country their candidates polled more than a million
votes and fourteen of them were returned to the house of
representatives to all outward signs a new and formidable party had
entered the lists

the sanguine hopes of the leaders proved to be illusory the quiet
operations of the resumption act the following year a revival of
industry from a severe panic which had set in during  the silver
purchase act and the reissue of greenbacks cut away some of the
grounds of agitation there was also a diversion of forces to the silver
faction which had a substantial support in the silver mine owners of the
west at all events the greenback vote fell to about  in the
election of  a still greater drop came four years later and the
party gave up the ghost its sponsors returning to their former
allegiance or sulking in their tents

the rise of the populist partythose leaders of the old parties who
now looked for a happy future unvexed by new factions were doomed to
disappointment the funeral of the greenback party was hardly over
before there arose two other political specters in the agrarian
sections the national farmers alliance and industrial union
particularly strong in the south and west and the farmers alliance
operating in the north by  the two orders claimed over three
million members as in the case of the grangers many years before the
leaders among them found an easy way into politics in  they held a
convention nominated a candidate for president and adopted the name of
peoples party from which they were known as populists their
platform in every line breathed a spirit of radicalism they declared
that the newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled public opinion
silenced business prostrate our homes covered with mortgages and the
land concentrating in the hands of capitalists the fruits of the
toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a
few having delivered this sweeping indictment the populists put
forward their remedies the free coinage of silver a graduated income
tax postal savings banks and government ownership of railways and
telegraphs at the same time they approved the initiative referendum
and popular election of senators and condemned the use of federal
troops in labor disputes on this platform the populists polled over a
million votes captured twentytwo presidential electors and sent a
powerful delegation to congress

industrial distress augments unrestthe four years intervening
between the campaign of  and the next presidential election brought
forth many events which aggravated the illfeeling expressed in the
portentous platform of populism cleveland a consistent enemy of free
silver gave his powerful support to the gold standard and insisted on
the repeal of the silver purchase act thus alienating an increasing
number of his own party in  a grave industrial crisis fell upon the
land banks and business houses went into bankruptcy with startling
rapidity factories were closed idle men thronged the streets hunting
for work and the prices of wheat and corn dropped to a ruinous level
labor disputes also filled the crowded record a strike at the pullman
car works in chicago spread to the railways disorders ensued president
cleveland against the protests of the governor of illinois john p
altgeld dispatched troops to the scene of action the united states
district court at chicago issued an injunction forbidding the president
of the railway union eugene v debs or his assistants to interfere
with the transmission of the mails or interstate commerce in any form
for refusing to obey the order debs was arrested and imprisoned with
federal troops in possession of the field with their leader in jail
the strikers gave up the battle defeated but not subdued to cap the
climax the supreme court of the united states the following year 
declared null and void the income tax law just enacted by congress thus
fanning the flames of populist discontent all over the west and south


the sound money battle of 

conservative men alarmedmen of conservative thought and leaning in
both parties were by this time thoroughly disturbed they looked upon
the rise of populism and the growth of labor disputes as the signs of a
revolutionary spirit indeed nothing short of a menace to american
institutions and ideals the income tax law of  exclaimed the
distinguished new york advocate joseph h choate in an impassioned
speech before the supreme court is communistic in its purposes and
tendencies and is defended here upon principles as communistic
socialisticwhat shall i call thempopulistic as ever have been
addressed to any political assembly in the world mr justice field in
the name of the court replied the present assault upon capital is but
the beginning it will be but the stepping stone to others larger and
more sweeping till our political conditions will become a war of the
poor against the rich in declaring the income tax unconstitutional he
believed that he was but averting greater evils lurking under its guise
as for free silver nearly all conservative men were united in calling
it a measure of confiscation and repudiation an effort of the debtors
to pay their obligations with money worth fifty cents on the dollar the
climax of villainies openly defended a challenge to law order and
honor

the republicans come out for the gold standardit was among the
republicans that this opinion was most widely shared and firmly held it
was they who picked up the gauge thrown down by the populists though a
host of democrats like cleveland and hill of new york also battled
against the growing populist defection in democratic ranks when the
republican national convention assembled in  the die was soon
cast a declaration of opposition to free silver save by international
agreement was carried by a vote of eight to one the republican party
to use the vigorous language of mr lodge arrayed itself against not
only that organized failure the democratic party but all the wandering
forces of political chaos and social disorder  in these bitter times
when the forces of disorder are loose and the wreckers with their false
lights gather at the shore to lure the ship of state upon the rocks
yet it is due to historic truth to state that mckinley whom the
republicans nominated had voted in congress for the free coinage of
silver was widely known as a bimetallist and was only with difficulty
persuaded to accept the unequivocal indorsement of the gold standard
which was pressed upon him by his counselors having accepted it
however he proved to be a valiant champion though his major interest
was undoubtedly in the protective tariff to him nothing was more
reprehensible than attempts to array class against class the classes
against the masses section against section labor against capital
the poor against the rich or interest against interest such was the
language of his acceptance speech the whole program of populism he now
viewed as a sudden dangerous and revolutionary assault upon law and
order

the democratic convention at chicagonever save at the great
disruption on the eve of the civil war did a democratic national
convention display more feeling than at chicago in  from the
opening prayer to the last motion before the house every act every
speech every scene every resolution evoked passions and sowed
dissensions departing from long party custom it voted down in anger a
proposal to praise the administration of the democratic president
cleveland when the platform with its radical planks including free
silver was reported a veritable storm broke senator hill trembling
with emotion protested against the departure from old tests of
democratic allegiance against principles that must drive out of the
party men who had grown gray in its service against revolutionary
unwise and unprecedented steps in the history of the party senator
vilas of wisconsin in great fervor avowed that there was no difference
in principle between the free coinage of silverthe confiscation of
onehalf of the credits of the nation for the benefit of debtorsand
communism itselfa universal distribution of property in the triumph
of that cause he saw the beginning of the overthrow of all law all
justice all security and repose in the social order

william j bryan in 

the crown of thorns speechthe champions of free silver replied in
strident tones they accused the gold advocates of being the aggressors
who had assailed the labor and the homes of the people william jennings
bryan of nebraska voiced their sentiments in a memorable oration he
declared that their cause was as holy as the cause of libertythe
cause of humanity he exclaimed that the contest was between the idle
holders of idle capital and the toiling millions then he named those
for whom he spokethe wageearner the country lawyer the small
merchant the farmer and the miner the man who is employed for wages
is as much a business man as his employer the attorney in a country
town is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great
metropolis the merchant at the cross roads store is as much a business
man as the merchant of new york the farmer  is as much a business
man as the man who goes upon the board of trade and bets upon the price
of grain the miners who go a thousand feet into the earth or climb two
thousand feet upon the cliffs  are as much business men as the few
financial magnates who in a back room corner the money of the world
it is for these that we speak we do not come as aggressors ours is not
a war of conquest we are fighting in defense of our homes our
families and our posterity we have petitioned and our petitions have
been scorned we have entreated and our entreaties have been
disregarded we have begged and they have mocked when our calamity came
we beg no longer we entreat no more we petition no more we defy
them we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to
them you shall not press upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns
you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold

bryan nominatedin all the history of national conventions never had
an orator so completely swayed a multitude not even yancey in his
memorable plea in the charleston convention of  when with grave and
moving eloquence he espoused the southern cause against the impending
fates the delegates after cheering mr bryan until they could cheer no
more tore the standards from the floor and gathered around the nebraska
delegation to renew the deafening applause the platform as reported was
carried by a vote of two to one and the young orator from the west
hailed as americas tiberius gracchus was nominated as the democratic
candidate for president the south and west had triumphed over the east
the division was sectional admittedly sectionalthe old combination of
power which calhoun had so anxiously labored to build up a century
earlier the gold democrats were repudiated in terms which were clear to
all a few unable to endure the thought of voting the republican
ticket held a convention at indianapolis where with the sanction of
cleveland they nominated candidates of their own and endorsed the gold
standard in a forlorn hope

the democratic platformit was to the call from chicago that the
democrats gave heed and the republicans made answer the platform on
which mr bryan stood unlike most party manifestoes was explicit in
its language and its appeal it denounced the practice of allowing
national banks to issue notes intended to circulate as money on the
ground that it was in derogation of the constitution recalling
jacksons famous attack on the bank in  it declared that tariff
duties should be laid for the purpose of revenuecalhouns doctrine
in demanding the free coinage of silver it recurred to the practice
abandoned in  the income tax came next on the program the platform
alleged that the law of  passed by a democratic congress was in
strict pursuance of the uniform decisions of the supreme court for
nearly a hundred years and then hinted that the decision annulling the
law might be reversed by the same body as it may hereafter be
constituted

the appeal to labor voiced by mr bryan in his crown of thorns speech
was reinforced in the platform as labor creates the wealth of the
country ran one plank we demand the passage of such laws as may be
necessary to protect it in all its rights referring to the recent
pullman strike the passions of which had not yet died away the
platform denounced arbitrary interference by federal authorities in
local affairs as a violation of the constitution of the united states
and a crime against free institutions a special objection was lodged
against government by injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of
oppression by which federal judges in contempt of the laws of states
and rights of citizens become at once legislators judges and
executioners the remedy advanced was a federal law assuring trial by
jury in all cases of contempt in labor disputes having made this
declaration of faith the democrats with mr bryan at the head raised
their standard of battle

the heated campaignthe campaign which ensued outrivaled in the
range of its educational activities and the bitterness of its tone all
other political conflicts in american history not excepting the fateful
struggle of  immense sums of money were contributed to the funds of
both parties railway banking and other corporations gave generously
to the republicans the silver miners less lavishly but with the same
anxiety supported the democrats the country was flooded with
pamphlets posters and handbills every public forum from the great
auditoriums of the cities to the red schoolhouses on the countryside
was occupied by the opposing forces

mr bryan took the stump himself visiting all parts of the country in
special trains and addressing literally millions of people in the open
air mr mckinley chose the older and more formal plan he received
delegations at his home in canton and discussed the issues of the
campaign from his front porch leaving to an army of wellorganized
orators the task of reaching the people in their home towns parades
processions and monster demonstrations filled the land with politics
whole states were polled in advance by the republicans and the doubtful
voters personally visited by men equipped with arguments and literature
manufacturers frightened at the possibility of disordered public
credit announced that they would close their doors if the democrats won
the election men were dismissed from public and private places on
account of their political views one eminent college president being
forced out for advocating free silver the language employed by
impassioned and embittered speakers on both sides roused the public to a
state of frenzy once more showing the lengths to which men could go in
personal and political abuse

the republican victorythe verdict of the nation was decisive
mckinley received  of the  electoral votes and  popular
votes as against bryans  the congressional elections were
equally positive although on account of the composition of the senate
the holdover democrats and populists still enjoyed a power out of
proportion to their strength as measured at the polls even as it was
the republicans got full control of both housesa dominion of the
entire government which they were to hold for fourteen yearsuntil the
second half of mr tafts administration when they lost possession of
the house of representatives the yoke of indecision was broken the
party of sound finance and protective tariffs set out upon its lease of
power with untroubled assurance


republican measures and results

the gold standard and the tariffyet strange as it may seem the
republicans did not at once enact legislation making the gold dollar the
standard for the national currency not until  did they take that
positive step in his first inaugural president mckinley as if still
uncertain in his own mind or fearing a revival of the contest just
closed placed the tariff not the money question in the forefront
the people have decided he said that such legislation should be had
as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and
development of our country protection for american industries
therefore he urged is the task before congress with adequate revenue
secured but not until then we can enter upon changes in our fiscal
laws as the republicans had only fortysix of the ninety senators and
at least four of them were known advocates of free silver the
discretion exercised by the president in selecting the tariff for
congressional debate was the better part of valor

congress gave heed to the warning under the direction of nelson p
dingley whose name was given to the bill a tariff measure levying the
highest rates yet laid in the history of american imposts was prepared
and driven through the house of representatives the opposition
encountered in the senate especially from the west was overcome by
concessions in favor of that section but the duties on sugar tin
steel lumber hemp and in fact all of the essential commodities
handled by combinations and trusts were materially raised

president mckinley and his cabinet

growth of combinationsthe years that followed the enactment of the
dingley law were whatever the cause the most prosperous the country
had witnessed for many a decade industries of every kind were soon
running full blast labor was employed commerce spread more swiftly
than ever to the markets of the world coincident with this progress was
the organization of the greatest combinations and trusts the world had
yet seen in  the smelters formed a trust with a capital of
 in the same year the standard oil company with a capital of
over one hundred millions took the place of the old trust and the
copper trust was incorporated under the laws of new jersey its par
value capital being fixed shortly afterward at  a year
later the national sugar refining company of new jersey started with a
capital of  adopting the policy of issuing to the
stockholders no public statement of its earnings or financial condition
before another twelvemonth had elapsed all previous corporate financing
was reduced to small proportions by the flotation of the united states
steel corporation with a capital of more than a billion dollars an
enterprise set in motion by the famous morgan banking house of new york

in nearly all these gigantic undertakings the same great leaders in
finance were more or less intimately associated to use the language of
an eminent authority they are all allied and intertwined by their
various mutual interests for instance the pennsylvania railroad
interests are on the one hand allied with the vanderbilts and on the
other with the rockefellers the vanderbilts are closely allied with the
morgan group viewed as a whole we find the dominating influences in
the trusts to be made up of a network of large and small capitalists
many allied to one another by ties of more or less importance but all
being appendages to or parts of the greater groups which are themselves
dependent on and allied with the two mammoth or rockefeller and morgan
groups these two mammoth groups jointly  constitute the heart of the
business and commercial life of the nation such was the picture of
triumphant business enterprise drawn by a financier within a few years
after the memorable campaign of 

america had become one of the first workshops of the world it was by
virtue of the closely knit organization of its business and finance one
of the most powerful and energetic leaders in the struggle of the giants
for the business of the earth the capital of the steel corporation
alone was more than ten times the total national debt which the apostles
of calamity in the days of washington and hamilton declared the nation
could never pay american industry filling domestic markets to
overflowing was ready for new worlds to conquer

chapter xx

america a world power 


it has now become a fashion sanctioned by wide usage and by eminent
historians to speak of america triumphant over spain and possessed of
new colonies as entering the twentieth century in the role of a world
power for the first time perhaps at this late day it is useless to
protest against the currency of the idea nevertheless the truth is
that from the fateful moment in march  when edmund burke unfolded
to his colleagues in the british parliament the resources of an
invincible america down to the settlement at versailles in  closing
the drama of the world war this nation has been a world power
influencing by its example by its institutions by its wealth trade
and arms the course of international affairs and it should be said also
that neither in the field of commercial enterprise nor in that of
diplomacy has it been wanting in spirit or ingenuity

when john hay secretary of state heard that an american citizen
perdicaris had been seized by raisuli a moroccan bandit in  he
wired his brusque message we want perdicaris alive or raisuli dead
this was but an echo of commodore decaturs equally characteristic
answer not a minute given nearly a hundred years before to the
pirates of algiers begging for time to consider whether they would cease
preying upon american merchantmen was it not as early as  that the
american commissioner caleb cushing taking advantage of the british
opium war on china negotiated with the celestial empire a successful
commercial treaty did he not then exultantly exclaim the laws of the
union follow its citizens and its banner protects them even within the
domain of the chinese empire was it not almost half a century before
the battle of manila bay in  that commodore perry with an adequate
naval force gently coerced japan into friendship with us leading all
the nations of the earth in the opening of that empire to the trade of
the occident nor is it inappropriate in this connection to recall the
fact that the monroe doctrine celebrates in  its hundredth
anniversary


american foreign relations 

french intrigues in mexico blockedbetween the war for the union and
the war with spain the department of state had many an occasion to
present the rights of america among the powers of the world only a
little while after the civil conflict came to a close it was called
upon to deal with a dangerous situation created in mexico by the
ambitions of napoleon iii during the administration of buchanan mexico
had fallen into disorder through the strife of the liberal and the
clerical parties the president asked for authority to use american
troops to bring to a peaceful haven a wreck upon the ocean drifting
about as she is impelled by different factions our own domestic crisis
then intervened

observing the united states heavily involved in its own problems the
great powers england france and spain decided in the autumn of 
to take a hand themselves in restoring order in mexico they entered
into an agreement to enforce the claims of their citizens against mexico
and to protect their subjects residing in that republic they invited
the united states to join them and on meeting a polite refusal they
prepared for a combined military and naval demonstration on their own
account in the midst of this action england and spain discovering the
sinister purposes of napoleon withdrew their troops and left the field
to him

the french emperor it was well known looked with jealousy upon the
growth of the united states and dreamed of establishing in the western
hemisphere an imperial power to offset the american republic
intervention to collect debts was only a cloak for his deeper designs
throwing off that guise in due time he made the archduke maximilian a
brother of the ruler of austria emperor in mexico and surrounded his
throne by french soldiers in spite of all protests

this insolent attack upon the mexican republic deeply resented in the
united states was allowed to drift in its course until  at that
juncture general sheridan was dispatched to the mexican border with a
large armed force general grant urged the use of the american army to
expel the french from this continent the secretary of state seward
counseled negotiation first and applying the monroe doctrine was able
to prevail upon napoleon iii to withdraw his troops without the support
of french arms the sham empire in mexico collapsed like a house of
cards and the unhappy maximilian the victim of french ambition and
intrigue met his death at the hands of a mexican firing squad

alaska purchasedthe mexican affair had not been brought to a close
before the department of state was busy with negotiations which resulted
in the purchase of alaska from russia the treaty of cession signed on
march   added to the united states a domain of nearly six
hundred thousand square miles a territory larger than texas and nearly
threefourths the size of the louisiana purchase though it was a
distant colony separated from our continental domain by a thousand miles
of water no question of imperialism or colonization foreign to
american doctrines seems to have been raised at the time the treaty
was ratified promptly by the senate the purchase price  was
voted by the house of representatives after the display of some
resentment against a system that compelled it to appropriate money to
fulfill an obligation which it had no part in making seward who
formulated the treaty rejoiced as he afterwards said that he had kept
alaska out of the hands of england

american interest in the caribbeanhaving achieved this diplomatic
triumph seward turned to the increase of american power in another
direction he negotiated with denmark a treaty providing for the
purchase of the islands of st john and st thomas in the west indies
strategic points in the caribbean for sea power this project long
afterward brought to fruition by other men was defeated on this
occasion by the refusal of the senate to ratify the treaty evidently it
was not yet prepared to exercise colonial dominion over other races

undaunted by the misadventure in caribbean policies president grant
warmly advocated the acquisition of santo domingo this little republic
had long been in a state of general disorder in  a treaty of
annexation was concluded with its president the document grant
transmitted to the senate with his cordial approval only to have it
rejected not at all changed in his opinion by the outcome of his
effort he continued to urge the subject of annexation even in his last
message to congress he referred to it saying that time had only proved
the wisdom of his early course the addition of santo domingo to the
american sphere of protection was the work of a later generation the
state department temporarily checked had to bide its time

the alabama claims arbitratedindeed it had in hand a far more
serious matter a vexing issue that grew out of civil war diplomacy the
british government as already pointed out in other connections had
permitted confederate cruisers including the famous alabama built in
british ports to escape and prey upon the commerce of the northern
states this action denounced at the time by our government as a grave
breach of neutrality as well as a grievous injury to american citizens
led first to remonstrances and finally to repeated claims for damages
done to american ships and goods for a long time great britain was
firm her foreign secretary denied all obligations in the premises
adding somewhat curtly that he wished to say once for all that her
majestys government disclaimed any responsibility for the losses and
hoped that they had made their position perfectly clear still
president grant was not persuaded that the door of diplomacy though
closed was barred hamilton fish his secretary of state renewed the
demand finally he secured from the british government in  the
treaty of washington providing for the arbitration not merely of the
alabama and other claims but also all points of serious controversy
between the two countries

the tribunal of arbitration thus authorized sat at geneva in
switzerland and after a long and careful review of the arguments on
both sides awarded to the united states the lump sum of  to
be distributed among the american claimants the damages thus allowed
were large unquestionably larger than strict justice required and it is
not surprising that the decision excited much adverse comment in
england nevertheless the prompt payment by the british government
swept away at once a great cloud of illfeeling in america moreover
the spectacle of two powerful nations choosing the way of peaceful
arbitration to settle an angry dispute seemed a happy if illusory omen
of a modern method for avoiding the arbitrament of war

samoaif the senate had its doubts at first about the wisdom of
acquiring strategic points for naval power in distant seas the same
could not be said of the state department or naval officers in 
commander meade of the united states navy alive to the importance of
coaling stations even in midocean made a commercial agreement with the
chief of tutuila one of the samoan islands far below the equator in
the southern pacific nearer to australia than to california this
agreement providing among other things for our use of the harbor of
pago pago as a naval base was six years later changed into a formal
treaty ratified by the senate

such enterprise could not escape the vigilant eyes of england and
germany both mindful of the course of the sea power in history the
german emperor seizing as a pretext a quarrel between his consul in the
islands and a native king laid claim to an interest in the samoan
group england aware of the dangers arising from german outposts in the
southern seas so near to australia was not content to stand aside so
it happened that all three countries sent battleships to the samoan
waters threatening a crisis that was fortunately averted by friendly
settlement if as is alleged germany entertained a notion of
challenging american sea power then and there the presence of british
ships must have dispelled that dream

the result of the affair was a tripartite agreement by which the three
powers in  undertook a protectorate over the islands but joint
control proved unsatisfactory there was constant friction between the
germans and the english the spheres of authority being vague and open
to dispute the plan had to be abandoned at the end of ten years
england withdrew altogether leaving to germany all the islands except
tutuila which was ceded outright to the united states thus one of the
finest harbors in the pacific to the intense delight of the american
navy passed permanently under american dominion another triumph in
diplomacy was set down to the credit of the state department

cleveland and the venezuela affairin the relations with south
america as well as in those with the distant pacific the diplomacy of
the government at washington was put to the test for some time it had
been watching a dispute between england and venezuela over the western
boundary of british guiana and on an appeal from venezuela it had
taken a lively interest in the contest in  president cleveland saw
that great britain would yield none of her claims after hearing the
arguments of venezuela his secretary of state richard t olney in a
note none too conciliatory asked the british government whether it was
willing to arbitrate the points in controversy this inquiry he
accompanied by a warning to the effect that the united states could not
permit any european power to contest its mastery in this hemisphere
the united states said the secretary is practically sovereign on
this continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it
confines its interposition its infinite resources combined with its
isolated position render it master of the situation and practically
invulnerable against any or all other powers

the reply evoked from the british government by this strong statement
was firm and clear the monroe doctrine it said even if not so widely
stretched by interpretation was not binding in international law the
dispute with venezuela was a matter of interest merely to the parties
involved and arbitration of the question was impossible this response
called forth president clevelands startling message of  he asked
congress to create a commission authorized to ascertain by researches
the true boundary between venezuela and british guiana he added that it
would be the duty of this country to resist by every means in its
power as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests the
appropriation by great britain of any lands or the exercise of
governmental jurisdiction over any territory which after investigation
we have determined of right belongs to venezuela the serious character
of this statement he thoroughly understood he declared that he was
conscious of his responsibilities intimating that war much as it was
to be deplored was not comparable to a supine submission to wrong and
injustice and the consequent loss of national selfrespect and honor

illustration grover cleveland

the note of defiance which ran through this message greeted by shrill
cries of enthusiasm in many circles was viewed in other quarters as a
portent of war responsible newspapers in both countries spoke of an
armed settlement of the dispute as inevitable congress created the
commission and appropriated money for the investigation a body of
learned men was appointed to determine the merits of the conflicting
boundary claims the british government deaf to the clamor of the
bellicose section of the london press deplored the incident
courteously replied in the affirmative to a request for assistance in
the search for evidence and finally agreed to the proposition that the
issue be submitted to arbitration the outcome of this somewhat perilous
dispute contributed not a little to clevelands reputation as a
sterling representative of the true american spirit this was not
diminished when the tribunal of arbitration found that great britain was
on the whole right in her territorial claims against venezuela

the annexation of hawaiiwhile engaged in the dangerous venezuela
controversy president cleveland was compelled by a strange turn in
events to consider the annexation of the hawaiian islands in the
midpacific for more than half a century american missionaries had been
active in converting the natives to the christian faith and enterprising
american business men had been developing the fertile sugar plantations
both the department of state and the navy department were fully
conscious of the strategic relation of the islands to the growth of sea
power and watched with anxiety any developments likely to bring them
under some other dominion

the country at large was indifferent however until  when a
revolution headed by americans broke out ending in the overthrow of
the native government the abolition of the primitive monarchy and the
retirement of queen liliuokalani to private life this crisis a
repetition of the texas affair in a small theater was immediately
followed by a demand from the new hawaiian government for annexation to
the united states president harrison looked with favor on the proposal
negotiated the treaty of annexation and laid it before the senate for
approval there it still rested when his term of office was brought to a
close

harrisons successor cleveland it was well known had doubts about the
propriety of american action in hawaii for the purpose of making an
inquiry into the matter he sent a special commissioner to the islands
on the basis of the report of his agent cleveland came to the
conclusion that the revolution in the island kingdom had been
accomplished by the improper use of the armed forces of the united
states and that the wrong should be righted by a restoration of the
queen to her throne such being his matured conviction though the
facts upon which he rested it were warmly controverted he could do
nothing but withdraw the treaty from the senate and close the incident

to the republicans this sharp and cavalier disposal of their plans
carried out in a way that impugned the motives of a republican
president was nothing less than a betrayal of american interests in
their platform of  they made clear their position our foreign
policy should be at all times firm vigorous and dignified and all our
interests in the western hemisphere carefully watched and guarded the
hawaiian islands should be controlled by the united states and no
foreign power should be permitted to interfere with them there was no
mistaking this view of the issue as the vote in the election gave
popular sanction to republican policies congress by a joint resolution
passed on july   annexed the islands to the united states and
later conferred upon them the ordinary territorial form of government


cuba and the spanish war

early american relations with cubathe year that brought hawaii
finally under the american flag likewise drew to a conclusion another
long controversy over a similar outpost in the atlantic one of the last
remnants of the once glorious spanish empirethe island of cuba

for a century the department of state had kept an anxious eye upon this
base of power knowing full well that both france and england already
well established in the west indies had their attention also fixed upon
cuba in the administration of president fillmore they had united in
proposing to the united states a tripartite treaty guaranteeing spain in
her none too certain ownership this proposal squarely rejected
furnished the occasion for a statement of american policy which stood
the test of all the years that followed namely that the affair was one
between spain and the united states alone

in that long contest in the united states for the balance of power
between the north and south leaders in the latter section often thought
of bringing cuba into the union to offset the free states an
opportunity to announce their purposes publicly was afforded in  by
a controversy over the seizure of an american ship by cuban authorities
on that occasion three american ministers abroad stationed at madrid
paris and london respectively held a conference and issued the
celebrated ostend manifesto they united in declaring that cuba by
her geographical position formed a part of the united states that
possession by a foreign power was inimical to american interests and
that an effort should be made to purchase the island from spain in case
the owner refused to sell they concluded with a menacing flourish by
every law human and divine we shall be justified in wresting it from
spain if we possess the power this startling proclamation to the world
was promptly disowned by the united states government

revolutions in cubafor nearly twenty years afterwards the cuban
question rested then it was revived in another form during president
grants administrations when the natives became engaged in a
destructive revolt against spanish officials for ten yearsa
guerrilla warfare raged in the island american citizens by virtue of
their ancient traditions of democracy naturally sympathized with a war
for independence and selfgovernment expeditions to help the insurgents
were fitted out secretly in american ports arms and supplies were
smuggled into cuba american soldiers of fortune joined their ranks the
enforcement of neutrality against the friends of cuban independence no
pleasing task for a sympathetic president the protection of american
lives and property in the revolutionary area and similar matters kept
our government busy with cuba for a whole decade

a brief lull in cuban disorders was followed in  by a renewal of the
revolutionary movement the contest between the rebels and the spanish
troops marked by extreme cruelty and a total disregard for life and
property exceeded all bounds of decency and once more raised the old
questions that had tormented grants administration gomez the leader
of the revolt intent upon provoking american interference laid waste
the land with fire and sword by a proclamation of november   he
ordered the destruction of sugar plantations and railway connections and
the closure of all sugar factories the work of ruin was completed by
the ruthless spanish general weyler who concentrated the inhabitants
from rural regions into military camps where they died by the hundreds
of disease and starvation stories of the atrocities bad enough in
simple form became lurid when transmuted into american news and deeply
moved the sympathies of the american people sermons were preached about
spanish misdeeds orators demanded that the cubans be sustained in
their heroic struggle for independence newspapers scouting the
ordinary forms of diplomatic negotiation spurned mediation and demanded
intervention and war if necessary

cuban revolutionists

president clevelands policycleveland chose the way of peace he
ordered the observance of the rule of neutrality he declined to act on
a resolution of congress in favor of giving to the cubans the rights of
belligerents anxious to bring order to the distracted island he
tendered to spain the good offices of the united states as mediator in
the contesta tender rejected by the spanish government with the broad
hint that president cleveland might be more vigorous in putting a stop
to the unlawful aid in money arms and supplies afforded to the
insurgents by american sympathizers thereupon the president returned to
the course he had marked out for himself leaving the public nuisance
to his successor president mckinley

republican policiesthe republicans in  found themselves in a
position to employ that firm vigorous and dignified foreign policy
which they had approved in their platform they had declared the
government of spain having lost control of cuba and being unable to

protect the property or lives of resident american citizens or to comply
with its treaty obligations we believe that the government of the
united states should actively use its influence and good offices to
restore peace and give independence to the island the american
property in cuba to which the republicans referred in their platform
amounted by this time to more than fifty million dollars the commerce
with the island reached more than one hundred millions annually and the
claims of american citizens against spain for property destroyed totaled
sixteen millions to the pleas of humanity which made such an effective
appeal to the hearts of the american people there were thus added
practical considerations of great weight

president mckinley negotiatesin the face of the swelling tide of
popular opinion in favor of quick drastic and positive action
mckinley chose first the way of diplomacy a short time after his
inauguration he lodged with the spanish government a dignified protest
against its policies in cuba thus opening a game of thrust and parry
with the suave ministers at madrid the results of the exchange of
notes were the recall of the obnoxious general weyler the appointment
of a governorgeneral less bloodthirsty in his methods a change in the
policy of concentrating civilians in military camps and finally a
promise of home rule for cuba there is no doubt that the spanish
government was eager to avoid a war that could have but one outcome the
american minister at madrid general woodford was convinced that firm
and patient pressure would have resulted in the final surrender of cuba
by the spanish government

the de lome and the maine incidentssuch a policy was defeated by
events in february  a private letter written by senor de lome
the spanish ambassador at washington expressing contempt for the
president of the united states was filched from the mails and passed
into the hands of a journalist william r hearst who published it to
the world in the excited state of american opinion few gave heed to
the grave breach of diplomatic courtesy committed by breaking open
private correspondence the spanish government was compelled to recall
de lome thus officially condemning his conduct

at this point a far more serious crisis put the pacific relations of the
two negotiating countries in dire peril on february  the battleship
maine riding in the harbor of havana was blown up and sunk carrying
to death two officers and two hundred and fiftyeight members of the
crew this tragedy ascribed by the american public to the malevolence
of spanish officials profoundly stirred an already furious nation
when on march  a commission of inquiry reported that the illfated
ship had been blown up by a submarine mine which had in turn set off
some of the ships magazines the worst suspicions seemed confirmed if
any one was inclined to be indifferent to the cuban war for
independence he was now met by the vehement cry remember the
maine

spanish concessionsstill the state department under mckinleys
steady hand pursued the path of negotiation spain proving more pliable
and more ready with promises of reform in the island early in april
however there came a decided change in the tenor of american diplomacy
on the th mckinley evidently convinced that promises did not mean
performances instructed our minister at madrid to warn the spanish
government that as no effective armistice had been offered to the
cubans he would lay the whole matter before congress this decision
every one knew from the temper of congress meant wara prospect which
excited all the european powers the pope took an active interest in the
crisis france and germany foreseeing from long experience in world
politics an increase of american power and prestige through war sought
to prevent it spain hopeless and conscious of her weakness at last
dispatched to the president a note promising to suspend hostilities to
call a cuban parliament and to grant all the autonomy that could be
reasonably asked

president mckinley calls for warfor reasons of his ownreasons
which have never yet been fully explainedmckinley ignored the final
program of concessions presented by spain at the very moment when his
patient negotiations seemed to bear full fruit he veered sharply from
his course and launched the country into the war by sending to congress
his militant message of april   without making public the last
note he had received from spain he declared that he was brought to the
end of his effort and the cause was in the hands of congress humanity
the protection of american citizens and property the injuries to
american commerce and business the inability of spain to bring about
permanent peace in the islandthese were the grounds for action that
induced him to ask for authority to employ military and naval forces in
establishing a stable government in cuba they were sufficient for a
public already straining at the leash

the resolution of congressthere was no doubt of the outcome when
the issue was withdrawn from diplomacy and placed in charge of congress
resolutions were soon introduced into the house of representatives
authorizing the president to employ armed force in securing peace and
order in the island and establishing by the free action of the people
thereof a stable and independent government of their own to the form
and spirit of this proposal the democrats and populists took exception
in the senate where they were stronger their position had to be
reckoned with by the narrow republican majority as the resolution
finally read the independence of cuba was recognized spain was called
upon to relinquish her authority and withdraw from the island and the
president was empowered to use force to the extent necessary to carry
the resolutions into effect furthermore the united states disclaimed
any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty jurisdiction or
control over said island except for the pacification thereof final
action was taken by congress on april   and approved by the
president on the following day

war and victorystartling events then followed in swift succession
the navy as a result in no small measure of the alertness of theodore
roosevelt assistant secretary of the department was ready for the
trial by battle on may  commodore dewey at manila bay shattered the
spanish fleet marking the doom of spanish dominion in the philippines
on july  the spanish fleet under admiral cervera in attempting to
escape from havana was utterly destroyed by american forces under
commodore schley on july  santiago invested by american troops
under general shafter and shelled by the american ships gave up the
struggle on july  general miles landed in porto rico on august 
general merritt and admiral dewey carried manila by storm the war was
over

the peace protocolspain had already taken cognizance of stern
facts as early as july   acting through the french ambassador
m cambon the madrid government approached president mckinley for a
statement of the terms on which hostilities could be brought to a close
after some skirmishing spain yielded reluctantly to the ultimatum on
august  the preliminary peace protocol was signed stipulating that
cuba should be free porto rico ceded to the united states and manila
occupied by american troops pending the formal treaty of peace on
october  the commissioners of the two countries met at paris to bring
about the final settlement

peace negotiationswhen the day for the first session of the
conference arrived the government at washington apparently had not made
up its mind on the final disposition of the philippines perhaps before
the battle of manila bay not ten thousand people in the united states
knew or cared where the philippines were certainly there was in the
autumn of  no decided opinion as to what should be done with the
fruits of deweys victory president mckinley doubtless voiced the
sentiment of the people when he stated to the peace commissioners on the
eve of their departure that there had originally been no thought of
conquest in the pacific

the march of events he added had imposed new duties on the country
incidental to our tenure in the philippines he said is the
commercial opportunity to which american statesmanship cannot be
indifferent it is just to use every legitimate means for the
enlargement of american trade on this ground he directed the
commissioners to accept not less than the cession of the island of
luzon the chief of the philippine group with its harbor of manila it
was not until the latter part of october that he definitely instructed
them to demand the entire archipelago on the theory that the occupation
of luzon alone could not be justified on political commercial or
humanitarian grounds this departure from the letter of the peace
protocol was bitterly resented by the spanish agents it was with
heaviness of heart that they surrendered the last sign of spains
ancient dominion in the far pacific

the final terms of peacethe treaty of peace as finally agreed
upon embraced the following terms the independence of cuba the
cession of porto rico guam and the philippines to the united states
the settlement of claims filed by the citizens of both countries the
payment of twenty million dollars to spain by the united states for the
philippines and the determination of the status of the inhabitants of
the ceded territories by congress the great decision had been made its
issue was in the hands of the senate where the democrats and the
populists held the balance of power under the requirement of the
twothirds vote for ratification

the contest in america over the treaty of peacethe publication of
the treaty committing the united states to the administration of distant
colonies directed the shifting tides of public opinion into two distinct
channels support of the policy and opposition to it the trend in
republican leadership long in the direction marked out by the treaty
now came into the open perhaps a majority of the men highest in the
councils of that party had undergone the change of heart reflected in
the letters of john hay secretary of state in august of  he had
hinted in a friendly letter to andrew carnegie that he sympathized
with the latters opposition to imperialism but he had added quickly
the only question in my mind is how far it is now possible for us to
withdraw from the philippines in november of the same year he wrote to
whitelaw reid one of the peace commissioners at paris there is a wild
and frantic attack now going on in the press against the whole
philippine transaction andrew carnegie really seems to be off his
head but all this confusion of tongues will go its way the country
will applaud the resolution that has been reached and you will return in
the role of conquering heroes with your brows bound with oak

senator beveridge of indiana and senator platt of connecticut accepting
the verdict of history as the proof of manifest destiny called for
unquestioning support of the administration in its final step every
expansion of our territory said the latter has been in accordance
with the irresistible law of growth we could no more resist the
successive expansions by which we have grown to be the strongest nation
on earth than a tree can resist its growth the history of territorial
expansion is the history of our nations progress and glory it is a
matter to be proud of not to lament we should rejoice that providence
has given us the opportunity to extend our influence our institutions
and our civilization into regions hitherto closed to us rather than
contrive how we can thwart its designs

this doctrine was savagely attacked by opponents of mckinleys policy
many a stanch republican joining with the majority of democrats in
denouncing the treaty as a departure from the ideals of the republic
senator vest introduced in the senate a resolution that under the
constitution of the united states no power is given to the federal
government to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as
colonies senator hoar of massachusetts whose long and honorable
career gave weight to his lightest words inveighed against the whole
procedure and to the end of his days believed that the new drift into
rivalry with european nations as a colonial power was fraught with
genuine danger our imperialistic friends he said seem to have
forgotten the use of the vocabulary of liberty they talk about giving
good government we shall give them such a government as we think they
are fitted for we shall give them a better government than they had
before why mr president that one phrase conveys to a free man and a
free people the most stinging of insults in that little phrase as in a
seed is contained the germ of all despotism and of all tyranny
government is not a gift free government is not to be given by all the
blended powers of earth and heaven it is a birthright it belongs as
our fathers said and as their children said as jefferson said and as
president mckinley said to human nature itself

the senate more conservative on the question of annexation than the
house of representatives composed of men freshly elected in the stirring
campaign of  was deliberate about ratification of the treaty the
democrats and populists were especially recalcitrant mr bryan hurried
to washington and brought his personal influence to bear in favor of
speedy action patriotism required ratification it was said in one
quarter the country desires peace and the senate ought not to delay it
was urged in another finally on february   the requisite
majority of twothirds was mustered many a senator who voted for the
treaty however sharing the misgivings of senator hoar as to the
dangers of imperialism indeed at the time the senators passed a
resolution declaring that the policy to be adopted in the philippines
was still an open question leaving to the future in this way the
possibility of retracing their steps

the attitude of englandthe spanish war while accomplishing the
simple objects of those who launched the nation on that course like all
other wars produced results wholly unforeseen in the first place it
exercised a profound influence on the drift of opinion among european
powers in england sympathy with the united states was from the first
positive and outspoken the state of feeling here wrote mr hay then
ambassador in london is the best i have ever known from every quarter
the evidences of it come to me the royal family by habit and tradition
are most careful not to break the rules of strict neutrality but even
among them i find nothing but hearty kindness andso far as is
consistent with proprietysympathy among the political leaders on both
sides i find not only sympathy but a somewhat eager desire that the
other fellows shall not seem more friendly

joseph chamberlain the distinguished liberal statesman thinking no
doubt of the continental situation said in a political address at the
very opening of the war that the next duty of englishmen is to
establish and maintain bonds of permanent unity with our kinsmen across
the atlantic i even go so far as to say that terrible as war may
be even war would be cheaply purchased if in a great and noble cause
the stars and stripes and the union jack should wave together over an
anglosaxon alliance to the american ambassador he added
significantly that he did not care a hang what they say about it on the
continent which was another way of expressing the hope that the
warning to germany and france was sufficient this friendly english
opinion so useful to the united states when a combination of powers to
support spain was more than possible removed all fears as to the
consequences of the war henry adams recalling days of humiliation in
london during the civil war when his father was the american
ambassador coolly remarked that it was the sudden appearance of
germany as the grizzly terror that frightened england into americas
arms but the net result in keeping the field free for an easy triumph
of american arms was none the less appreciated in washington where
despite outward calm fears of european complications were never absent


american policies in the philippines and the orient

the filipino revolt against american rulein the sphere of domestic
politics as well as in the field of foreign relations the outcome of
the spanish war exercised a marked influence it introduced at once
problems of colonial administration and difficulties in adjusting trade
relations with the outlying dominions these were furthermore
complicated in the very beginning by the outbreak of an insurrection
against american sovereignty in the philippines the leader of the
revolt aguinaldo had been invited to join the american forces in
overthrowing spanish dominion and he had assumed apparently without
warrant that independence would be the result of the joint operations
when the news reached him that the american flag had been substituted
for the spanish flag his resentment was keen in february  there
occurred a slight collision between his men and some american soldiers
the conflict thus begun was followed by serious fighting which finally
dwindled into a vexatious guerrilla warfare lasting three years and
costing heavily in men and money atrocities were committed by the
native insurrectionists and sad to relate they were repaid in kind
it was argued in defense of the army that the ordinary rules of warfare
were without terror to men accustomed to fighting like savages in vain
did mckinley assure the filipinos that the institutions and laws
established in the islands would be designed not for our satisfaction
or for the expression of our theoretical views but for the happiness
peace and prosperity of the people of the philippine islands nothing
short of military pressure could bring the warring revolutionists to
terms

attacks on republican imperialismthe filipino insurrection
following so quickly upon the ratification of the treaty with spain
moved the american opponents of mckinleys colonial policies to redouble
their denunciation of what they were pleased to call imperialism
senator hoar was more than usually caustic in his indictment of the new
course the revolt against american rule did but convince him of the
folly hidden in the first fateful measures everywhere he saw a
conspiracy of silence and injustice i have failed to discover in the
speeches public or private of the advocates of this war he contended
in the senate or in the press which supports it and them a single
expression anywhere of a desire to do justice to the people of the
philippine islands or of a desire to make known to the people of the
united states the truth of the case the catchwords the cries the
pithy and pregnant phrases of which their speech is full all mean
dominion they mean perpetual dominion there is not one of these
gentlemen who will rise in his place and affirm that if he were a
filipino he would not do exactly as the filipinos are doing that he
would not despise them if they were to do otherwise so much at least
they owe of respect to the dead and buried historythe dead and buried
history so far as they can slay and bury itof their country in the
way of practical suggestions the senator offered as a solution of the
problem the recognition of independence assistance in establishing
selfgovernment and an invitation to all powers to join in a guarantee
of freedom to the islands

the republican answerto mckinley and his supporters engaged in a
sanguinary struggle to maintain american supremacy such talk was more
than quixotic it was scarcely short of treasonable they pointed out
the practical obstacles in the way of uniform selfgovernment for a
collection of seven million people ranging in civilization from the most
ignorant hill men to the highly cultivated inhabitants of manila the
incidents of the revolt and its repression they admitted were painful
enough but still nothing as compared with the chaos that would follow
the attempt of a people who had never had experience in such matters to
set up and sustain democratic institutions they preferred rather the
gradual process of fitting the inhabitants of the islands for
selfgovernment this course in their eyes though less poetic was
more in harmony with the ideals of humanity having set out upon it
they pursued it steadfastly to the end first they applied force
without stint to the suppression of the revolt then they devoted such
genius for colonial administration as they could command to the
development of civil government commerce and industry

a philippine home

the boxer rebellion in chinafor a nation with a worldwide trade
steadily growing as the progress of home industries redoubled the zeal
for new markets isolation was obviously impossible never was this
clearer than in  when a native revolt against foreigners in china
known as the boxer uprising compelled the united states to join with
the powers of europe in a military expedition and a diplomatic
settlement the boxers a chinese association had for some time carried
on a campaign of hatred against all aliens in the celestial empire
calling upon the natives to rise in patriotic wrath and drive out the
foreigners who they said were lacerating china like tigers in the
summer of  the revolt flamed up in deeds of cruelty missionaries
and traders were murdered in the provinces foreign legations were
stoned the german ambassador one of the most cordially despised
foreigners was killed in the streets of peking and to all appearances
a frightful war of extermination had begun in the month of june nearly
five hundred men women and children representing all nations were
besieged in the british quarters in peking under constant fire of
chinese guns and in peril of a terrible death

intervention in chinanothing but the arrival of armed forces made
up of japanese russian british american french and german soldiers
and marines prevented the destruction of the beleaguered aliens when
once the foreign troops were in possession of the chinese capital
diplomatic questions of the most delicate character arose for more than
half a century the imperial powers of europe had been carving up the
chinese empire taking to themselves territory railway concessions
mining rights ports and commercial privileges at the expense of the
huge but helpless victim the united states alone among the great
nations while as zealous as any in the pursuit of peaceful trade had
refrained from seizing chinese territory or ports moreover the
department of state had been urging european countries to treat china
with fairness to respect her territorial integrity and to give her
equal trading privileges with all nations

the american policy of the open doorin the autumn of 
secretary hay had addressed to london berlin rome paris tokyo and
st petersburg his famous note on the open door policy in china in
this document he proposed that existing treaty ports and vested
interests of the several foreign countries should be respected that
the chinese government should be permitted to extend its tariffs to all
ports held by alien powers except the few free ports and that there
should be no discrimination in railway and port charges among the
citizens of foreign countries operating in the empire to these
principles the governments addressed by mr hay finally acceded with
evident reluctance

on this basis he then proposed the settlement that had to follow the
boxer uprising the policy of the government of the united states he
said to the great powers in the summer of  is to seek a solution
which may bring about permanent safety and peace to china preserve
chinese territorial and administrative entity protect all rights
guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law and
safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with
all parts of the chinese empire this was a friendly warning to the
world that the united states would not join in a scramble to punish the
chinese by carving out more territory the moment we acted said mr
hay the rest of the world paused and finally came over to our ground
and the german government which is generally brutal but seldom silly
recovered its senses and climbed down off its perch

in taking this position the secretary of state did but reflect the
common sense of america we are of course he explained opposed to
the dismemberment of that empire and we do not think that the public
opinion of the united states would justify this government in taking
part in the great game of spoliation now going on heavy damages were
collected by the european powers from china for the injuries inflicted
upon their citizens by the boxers but the united states finding the
sum awarded in excess of the legitimate claims returned the balance in
the form of a fund to be applied to the education of chinese students in
american universities i would rather be i think said mr hay the
dupe of china than the chum of the kaiser by pursuing a liberal
policy he strengthened the hold of the united states upon the
affections of the chinese people and in the long run as he remarked
himself safeguarded our great commercial interests in that empire

imperialism in the presidential campaign of it is not strange
that the policy pursued by the republican administration in disposing of
the questions raised by the spanish war became one of the first issues
in the presidential campaign of  anticipating attacks from every
quarter the republicans in renominating mckinley set forth their
position in clear and ringing phrases in accepting by the treaty of
paris the just responsibility of our victories in the spanish war the
president and senate won the undoubted approval of the american people
no other course was possible than to destroy spains sovereignty
throughout the west indies and in the philippine islands that course
created our responsibility before the world and with the unorganized
population whom our intervention had freed from spain to provide for
the maintenance of law and order and for the establishment of good
government and for the performance of international obligations our
authority could not be less than our responsibility and wherever
sovereign rights were extended it became the high duty of the government
to maintain its authority to put down armed insurrection and to confer
the blessings of liberty and civilization upon all the rescued peoples
the largest measure of selfgovernment consistent with their welfare and
our duties shall be secured to them by law to give more strength to
their ticket the republican convention in a whirlwind of enthusiasm
nominated for the vice presidency against his protest theodore
roosevelt the governor of new york and the hero of the rough riders so
popular on account of their cuban campaign

the democrats as expected picked up the gauntlet thrown down with such
defiance by the republicans mr bryan whom they selected as their
candidate still clung to the currency issue but the main emphasis
both of the platform and the appeal for votes was on the imperialistic
program of the republican administration the democrats denounced the
treatment of cuba and porto rico and condemned the philippine policy in
sharp and vigorous terms as we are not willing ran the platform to
surrender our civilization or to convert the republic into an empire we
favor an immediate declaration of the nations purpose to give to the
filipinos first a stable form of government second independence
third protection from outside interference the greedy commercialism
which dictated the philippine policy of the republican administration
attempts to justify it with the plea that it will pay but even this
sordid and unworthy plea fails when brought to the test of facts the
war of criminal aggression against the filipinos entailing an annual
expense of many millions has already cost more than any possible profit
that could accrue from the entire philippine trade for years to come
we oppose militarism it means conquest abroad and intimidation and
oppression at home it means the strong arm which has ever been fatal to
free institutions it is what millions of our citizens have fled from in
europe it will impose upon our peaceloving people a large standing
army an unnecessary burden of taxation and would be a constant menace
to their liberties such was the tenor of their appeal to the voters

with the issues clearly joined the country rejected the democratic
candidate even more positively than four years before the popular vote
cast for mckinley was larger and that cast for bryan smaller than in the
silver election thus vindicated at the polls mckinley turned with
renewed confidence to the development of the policies he had so far
advanced but fate cut short his designs in the september following his
second inauguration he was shot by an anarchist while attending the
buffalo exposition what a strange and tragic fate it has been of
mine wrote the secretary of state john hay on the day of the
presidents death to stand by the bier of three of my dearest friends
lincoln garfield and mckinley three of the gentlest of men all risen
to the head of the state and all done to death by assassins on
september   the vice president theodore roosevelt took up the
lines of power that had fallen from the hands of his distinguished
chief promising to continue absolutely unbroken the policies he had
inherited


summary of national growth and world politics

the economic aspects of the period between  and  may be readily
summed up the recovery of the south from the ruin of the civil war the
extension of the railways the development of the great west and the
triumph of industry and business enterprise in the south many of the
great plantations were broken up and sold in small farms crops were
diversified the small farming class was raised in the scale of social
importance the cotton industry was launched and the coal iron
timber and other resources were brought into use in the west the free
arable land was practically exhausted by  under the terms of the
homestead act gold silver copper coal and other minerals were
discovered in abundance numerous rail connections were formed with the
atlantic seaboard the cowboy and the indian were swept away before a
standardized civilization of electric lights and bathtubs by the end of
the century the american frontier had disappeared the wild primitive
life so long associated with america was gone the unity of the nation
was established

in the field of business enterprise progress was most marked the
industrial system which had risen and flourished before the civil war
grew into immense proportions and the industrial area was extended from
the northeast into all parts of the country small business concerns
were transformed into huge corporations individual plants were merged
under the management of gigantic trusts short railway lines were
consolidated into national systems the industrial population of
wageearners rose into the tens of millions the immigration of aliens
increased by leaps and bounds the cities overshadowed the country the
nation that had once depended upon europe for most of its manufactured
goods became a competitor of europe in the markets of the earth

in the sphere of politics the period witnessed the recovery of white
supremacy in the south the continued discussion of the old questions
such as the currency the tariff and national banking and the
injection of new issues like the trusts and labor problems as of old
foreign affairs were kept well at the front alaska was purchased from
russia attempts were made to extend american influence in the caribbean
region a samoan island was brought under the flag and the hawaiian
islands were annexed the monroe doctrine was applied with vigor in the
dispute between venezuela and great britain

assistance was given to the cubans in their revolutionary struggle
against spain and thus there was precipitated a war which ended in the
annexation of porto rico and the philippines american influence in the
pacific and the orient was so enlarged as to be a factor of great weight
in world affairs thus questions connected with foreign and imperial
policies were united with domestic issues to make up the warp and woof
of politics in the direction of affairs the republicans took the
leadership for they held the presidency during all the years except
eight between  and

the evolution of republican policies 


the personality and early career of roosevelton september  
when theodore roosevelt took the oath of office the presidency passed
to a new generation and a leader of a new type recalling if comparisons
must be made andrew jackson rather than any republican predecessor
roosevelt was brusque hearty restless and fond of actiona young
fellow of infinite dash and originality as john hay remarked of him
combining the spirit of his old college harvard with the breezy
freedom of the plains interested in everythinga new species of game
a new book a diplomatic riddle or a novel theory of history or
biology though only fortythree years old he was well versed in the art
of practical politics coming upon the political scene in the early
eighties he had associated himself with the reformers in the republican
party but he was no mugwump from the first he vehemently preached the
doctrine of party loyalty if beaten in the convention he voted the
straight ticket in the election for twenty years he adhered to this
rule and during a considerable portion of that period he held office as
a spokesman of his party he served in the new york legislature as head
of the metropolitan police force as federal civil service commissioner
under president harrison as assistant secretary of the navy under
president mckinley and as governor of the empire state political
managers of the old school spoke of him as brilliant but erratic they
soon found him equal to the shrewdest in negotiation and action

foreign affairs

the panama canalthe most important foreign question confronting
president roosevelt on the day of his inauguration that of the panama
canal was a heritage from his predecessor the idea of a water route
across the isthmus long a dream of navigators had become a living
issue after the historic voyage of the battleship oregon around south
america during the spanish war but before the united states could act
it had to undo the claytonbulwer treaty made with great britain in
 providing for the construction of the canal under joint
supervision this was finally effected by the haypauncefote treaty of
 authorizing the united states to proceed alone on condition that
there should be no discriminations against other nations in the matter
of rates and charges

this accomplished it was necessary to decide just where the canal
should be built one group in congress favored the route through
nicaragua in fact two official commissions had already approved that
location another group favored cutting the way through panama after
purchasing the rights of the old french company which under the
direction of de lesseps the hero of the suez canal had made a costly
failure some twenty years before after a heated argument over the
merits of the two plans preference was given to the panama route as
the isthmus was then a part of colombia president roosevelt proceeded
to negotiate with the government at bogota a treaty authorizing the
united states to cut a canal through its territory the treaty was
easily framed but it was rejected by the colombian senate much to the
presidents exasperation you could no more make an agreement with the
colombian rulers he exclaimed than you could nail jelly to a wall
he was spared the necessity by a timely revolution on november  
panama renounced its allegiance to colombia and three days later the
united states recognized its independence

right and contractors hill on left june 

this amazing incident was followed shortly by the signature of a treaty
between panama and the united states in which the latter secured the
right to construct the longdiscussed canal in return for a guarantee
of independence and certain cash payments the rights and property of
the french concern were then bought and the final details settled a
lock rather than a sealevel canal was agreed upon construction by the
government directly instead of by private contractors was adopted
scientific medicine was summoned to stamp out the tropical diseases
that had made panama a plague spot finally in  as the president
said the dirt began to fly after surmounting formidable
difficultiesengineering labor and sanitarythe american forces in
 joined the waters of the atlantic and the pacific nearly eight
thousand miles were cut off the sea voyage from new york to san
francisco if any were inclined to criticize president roosevelt for
the way in which he snapped off negotiations with colombia and
recognized the panama revolutionists their attention was drawn to the
magnificent outcome of the affair notwithstanding the treaty with great
britain congress passed a tolls bill discriminating in rates in favor
of american ships it was only on the urgent insistence of president
wilson that the measure was later repealed

the conclusion of the russojapanese warthe applause which greeted
the presidents next diplomatic stroke was unmarred by censure of any
kind in the winter of  there broke out between japan and russia a
terrible conflict over the division of spoils in manchuria the fortunes
of war were with the agile forces of nippon in this struggle it seems
president roosevelts sympathies were mainly with the japanese although
he observed the proprieties of neutrality at all events secretary hay
wrote in his diary on new years day  that the president was
quite firm in his view that we cannot permit japan to be robbed a
second time of her victory referring to the fact that japan ten years
before after defeating china on the field of battle had been forced by
russia germany and france to forego the fruits of conquest

whatever the presidents personal feelings may have been he was aware
that japan despite her triumphs over russia was staggering under a
heavy burden of debt at a suggestion from tokyo he invited both
belligerents in the summer of  to join in a peace conference the
celerity of their reply was aided by the pressure of european bankers
who had already come to a substantial agreement that the war must stop
after some delay portsmouth new hampshire was chosen as the meeting
place for the spokesmen of the two warring powers roosevelt presided
over the opening ceremonies with fine urbanity thoroughly enjoying the
justly earned honor of being for the moment at the center of the worlds
interest he had the satisfaction of seeing the conference end in a
treaty of peace and amity

the monroe doctrine applied to germanyless spectacular than the
russojapanese settlement but not less important was a diplomatic
passageatarms with germany over the monroe doctrine this clash grew
out of the inability or unwillingness of the venezuelan government to
pay debts due foreign creditors having exhausted their patience in
negotiations england and germany in december  sent battleships to
establish what they characterized as a peaceful blockade of venezuelan
ports their action was followed by the rupture of diplomatic relations
there was a possibility that war and the occupation of venezuelan
territory might result

while unwilling to stand between a latinamerican country and its
creditors president roosevelt was determined that debt collecting
should not be made an excuse for european countries to seize territory
he therefore urged arbitration of the dispute winning the assent of
england and italy germany with a somewhat haughty air refused to take
the milder course the president learning of this refusal called the
german ambassador to the white house and informed him in very precise
terms that unless the imperial german government consented to
arbitrate admiral dewey would be ordered to the scene with instructions
to prevent germany from seizing any venezuelan territory a week passed
and no answer came from berlin not baffled the president again took
the matter up with the ambassador this time with even more firmness he
stated in language admitting of but one meaning that unless within
fortyeight hours the emperor consented to arbitration american
battleships already coaled and cleared would sail for venezuelan
waters the hint was sufficient the kaiser accepted the proposal and
the president with the fine irony of diplomacy complimented him
publicly on being so stanch an advocate of arbitration in terms of
the monroe doctrine this action meant that the united states while not
denying the obligations of debtors would not permit any move on the
part of european powers that might easily lead to the temporary or
permanent occupation of latinamerican territory

the santo domingo affairthe same issue was involved in a
controversy over santo domingo which arose in  the dominican
republic like venezuela was heavily in debt and certain european
countries declared that unless the united states undertook to look
after the finances of the embarrassed debtor they would resort to armed
coercion what was the united states to do the danger of having some
european power strongly intrenched in santo domingo was too imminent to
be denied president roosevelt acted with characteristic speed and
notwithstanding strong opposition in the senate was able in  to
effect a treaty arrangement which placed dominican finances under
american supervision

in the course of the debate over this settlement a number of
interesting questions arose it was pertinently asked whether the
american navy should be used to help creditors collect their debts
anywhere in latinamerica it was suggested also that no sanction should
be given to the practice among european governments of using armed force
to collect private claims opponents of president roosevelts policy
and they were neither few nor insignificant urged that such matters
should be referred to the hague court or to special international
commissions for arbitration to this the answer was made that the united
states could not surrender any question coming under the terms of the
monroe doctrine to the decision of an international tribunal the
position of the administration was very clearly stated by president
roosevelt himself the country he said would certainly decline to
go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt
on the other hand it is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to
take possession even temporarily of the customs houses of an american
republic in order to enforce the payment of its obligations for such a
temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation the only
escape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must
ourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as
possible of a just obligation shall be paid the monroe doctrine was
negative it denied to european powers a certain liberty of operation in
this hemisphere the positive obligations resulting from its application
by the united states were points now emphasized and developed

the hague conferencethe controversies over latinamerican relations
and his part in bringing the russojapanese war to a close naturally
made a deep impression upon roosevelt turning his mind in the direction
of the peaceful settlement of international disputes the subject was
moreover in the air as if conscious of impending calamity the
statesmen of the old world to all outward signs at least seemed
searching for a way to reduce armaments and avoid the bloody and costly
trial of international causes by the ancient process of battle it was
the czar nicholas ii fated to die in one of the terrible holocausts
which he helped to bring upon mankind who summoned the delegates of the
nations in the first hague peace conference in  the conference did
nothing to reduce military burdens or avoid wars but it did recognize
the right of friendly nations to offer the services of mediation to
countries at war and did establish a court at the hague for the
arbitration of international disputes

encouraged by this experiment feeble as it was president roosevelt in
 proposed a second conference yielding to the czar the honor of
issuing the call at this great international assembly held at the
hague in  the representatives of the united states proposed a plan
for the compulsory arbitration of certain matters of international
dispute this was rejected with contempt by germany reduction of
armaments likewise proposed in the conference was again deferred in
fact nothing was accomplished beyond agreement upon certain rules for
the conduct of civilized warfare casting a somewhat lurid light upon
the pacific intentions of most of the powers assembled

the world tour of the fleetas if to assure the world then that the
united states placed little reliance upon the frail reed of peace
conferences roosevelt the following year  made an imposing
display of american naval power by sending a fleet of sixteen
battleships on a tour around the globe on his own authority he ordered
the ships to sail out of hampton roads and circle the earth by way of
the straits of magellan san francisco australia the philippines
china japan and the suez canal this enterprise was not as some
critics claimed a mere boyish flourish president roosevelt knew how
deep was the influence of sea power on the fate of nations he was aware
that no country could have a wide empire of trade and dominion without
force adequate to sustain it the voyage around the world therefore
served a double purpose it interested his own country in the naval
program of the government and it reminded other powers that the
american giant though quiet was not sleeping in the midst of
international rivalries


colonial administration

a constitutional question settledin colonial administration as in
foreign policy president roosevelt advanced with firm step in a path
already marked out president mckinley had defined the principles that
were to control the development of porto rico and the philippines the
republican party had announced a program of pacification gradual
selfgovernment and commercial improvement the only remaining question
of importance to use the popular phrasedoes the constitution follow
the flaghad been answered by the supreme court of the united states
although it was well known that the constitution did not contemplate the
government of dependencies such as the philippines and porto rico the
court by generous and ingenious interpretations found a way for
congress to apply any reasonable rules required by the occasion

porto ricothe government of porto rico was a relatively simple
matter it was a single island with a fairly homogeneous population
apart from the spanish upper class for a time after military occupation
in  it was administered under military rule this was succeeded by
the establishment of civil government under the organic act passed by
congress in  the law assured to the porto ricans american
protection but withheld american citizenshipa boon finally granted in
 it provided for a governor and six executive secretaries appointed
by the president with the approval of the senate and for a legislature
of two housesone elected by popular native vote and an upper chamber
composed of the executive secretaries and five other persons appointed
in the same manner thus the united states turned back to the provincial
system maintained by england in virginia or new york in old colonial
days the natives were given a voice in their government and the power
of initiating laws but the final word both in lawmaking and
administration was vested in officers appointed in washington such was
the plan under which the affairs of porto rico were conducted by
president roosevelt it lasted until the new organic act of

the philippinesthe administration of the philippines presented far
more difficult questions the number of islands the variety of
languages and races the differences in civilization all combined to
challenge the skill of the government moreover there was raging in
 a stubborn revolt against american authority which had to be
faced following the lines laid down by president mckinley the
evolution of american policy fell into three stages at first the
islands were governed directly by the president under his supreme
military power in  a civilian commission headed by william howard
taft was selected by the president and charged with the government of
the provinces in which order had been restored six years later under
the terms of an organic act passed by congress in  the third stage
was reached the local government passed into the hands of a governor
and commission appointed by the president and senate and a
legislatureone house elected by popular vote and an upper chamber

composed of the commission this scheme like that obtaining in porto
rico remained intact until a democratic congress under president
wilsons leadership carried the colonial administration into its fourth
phase by making both houses elective thus by the steady pursuit of a
liberal policy selfgovernment was extended to the dependencies but it
encouraged rather than extinguished the vigorous movement among the
philippine natives for independence

cuban relationswithin the sphere of colonial affairs cuba though
nominally independent also presented problems to the government at
washington in the fine enthusiasm that accompanied the declaration of
war on spain congress unmindful of practical considerations
recognized the independence of cuba and disclaimed any disposition or
intention to exercise sovereignty jurisdiction or control over said
island except for the pacification thereof in the settlement that
followed the war however it was deemed undesirable to set the young
republic adrift upon the stormy sea of international politics without a
guiding hand before withdrawing american troops from the island
congress in march  enacted and required cuba to approve a
series of restrictions known as the platt amendment limiting her power
to incur indebtedness securing the right of the united states to
intervene whenever necessary to protect life and property and reserving
to the united states coaling stations at certain points to be agreed
upon the cubans made strong protests against what they deemed
infringements of their sovereignty but finally with good grace
accepted their fate even when in  president roosevelt landed
american troops in the island to quell a domestic dissension they
acquiesced in the action evidently regarding it as a distinct warning
that they should learn to manage their elections in an orderly manner


the roosevelt domestic policies

social questions to the frontfrom the day of his inauguration to
the close of his service in  president roosevelt in messages
speeches and interviews kept up a lively and interesting discussion of
trusts capital labor poverty riches lawbreaking good citizenship
and kindred themes many a subject previously touched upon only by
representatives of the minor and dissenting parties he dignified by a
careful examination that he did this with any fixed design or policy in
mind does not seem to be the case he admitted himself that when he
became president he did not have in hand any settled or farreaching
plan of social betterment he did have however serious convictions on
general principles i was bent upon making the government he wrote
the most efficient possible instrument in helping the people of the
united states to better themselves in every way politically socially
and industrially i believed with all my heart in real and
thoroughgoing democracy and i wished to make the democracy industrial
as well as political although i had only partially formulated the
method i believed we should follow it is thus evident at least that he
had departed a long way from the old idea of the government as nothing
but a great policeman keeping order among the people in a struggle over
the distribution of the nations wealth and resources

roosevelts view of the constitutionequally significant was
roosevelts attitude toward the constitution and the office of
president he utterly repudiated the narrow construction of our national
charter he held that the constitution should be treated as the
greatest document ever devised by the wit of man to aid a people in
exercising every power necessary for its own betterment not as a
straitjacket cunningly fashioned to strangle growth he viewed the
presidency as he did the constitution strict constructionists of the
jeffersonian school of whom there were many on occasion even in the
republican party had taken a view that the president could do nothing
that he was not specifically authorized by the constitution to do
roosevelt took exactly the opposite position it was his opinion that it
was not only the presidents right but his duty to do anything that the
needs of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the
constitution or the laws he went on to say that he acted for the
common wellbeing of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was
necessary unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative
prohibition

the trusts and railwaysto the trust question roosevelt devoted
especial attention this was unavoidable by far the larger part of the
business of the country was done by corporations as distinguished from
partnerships and individual owners the growth of these gigantic
aggregations of capital had been the leading feature in american
industrial development during the last two decades of the nineteenth
century in the conquest of business by trusts and the resulting
private fortunes of great magnitude the populists and the democrats
had seen a grievous danger to the republic plutocracy has taken the
place of democracy the tariff breeds trusts let us destroy therefore
the tariff and the trustssuch was the battle cry which had been taken
up by bryan and his followers

president roosevelt countered vigorously he rejected the idea that the
trusts were the product of the tariff or of governmental action of any
kind he insisted that they were the outcome of natural economic
forces  destructive competition among business men compelling them
to avoid ruin by cooperation in fixing prices  the growth of markets
on a national scale and even international scale calling for vast
accumulations of capital to carry on such business  the possibility
of immense savings by the union of many plants under one management in
the corporation he saw a new stage in the development of american
industry unregulated competition he regarded as the source of evils
which all men concede must be remedied if this civilization of ours is
to survive the notion therefore that these immense business concerns
should be or could be broken up by a decree of law roosevelt considered
absurd

at the same time he proposed that evil trusts should be prevented from
wrongdoing of any kind that is punished for plain swindling for
making agreements to limit output for refusing to sell to customers who
dealt with rival firms and for conspiracies with railways to ruin
competitors by charging high freight rates and for similar abuses
accordingly he proposed not the destruction of the trusts but their
regulation by the government this he contended would preserve the
advantages of business on a national scale while preventing the evils
that accompanied it the railway company he declared to be a public
servant its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike
so he answered those who thought that trusts and railway combinations
were private concerns to be managed solely by their owners without let
or hindrance and also those who thought trusts and railway combinations
could be abolished by tariff reduction or criminal prosecution

the labor questionon the labor question then pressing to the front
in public interest president roosevelt took advanced ground for his
time he declared that the workingman singlehanded and emptyhanded
threatened with starvation if unemployed was no match for the employer
who was able to bargain and wait this led him accordingly to accept
the principle of the trade union namely that only by collective
bargaining can labor be put on a footing to measure its strength equally
with capital while he severely arraigned labor leaders who advocated
violence and destructive doctrines he held that the organization of
labor into trade unions and federations is necessary is beneficent and
is one of the greatest possible agencies in the attainment of a true
industrial as well as a true political democracy in the united
states the last resort of trade unions in labor disputes the strike
he approved in case negotiations failed to secure a fair deal

he thought however that labor organizations even if wisely managed
could not solve all the pressing social questions of the time the aid
of the government at many points he believed to be necessary to
eliminate undeserved poverty industrial diseases unemployment and the
unfortunate consequences of industrial accidents in his first message
of  for instance he urged that workers injured in industry should
have certain and ample compensation from time to time he advocated
other legislation to obtain what he called a larger measure of social
and industrial justice

great riches and taxationeven the challenge of the radicals such
as the populists who alleged that the toil of millions is boldly
stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a fewchallenges which his
predecessors did not consider worthy of noticepresident roosevelt
refused to let pass without an answer in his first message he denied
the truth of the common saying that the rich were growing richer and the
poor were growing poorer he asserted that on the contrary the average
man wage worker farmer and small business man was better off than
ever before in the history of our country that there had been abuses in
the accumulation of wealth he did not pretend to ignore but he believed
that even immense fortunes on the whole represented positive benefits
conferred upon the country nevertheless he felt that grave dangers to
the safety and the happiness of the people lurked in great inequalities
of wealth in  he wrote that he wished it were in his power to
prevent the heaping up of enormous fortunes the next year to the
astonishment of many leaders in his own party he boldly announced in a
message to congress that he approved both income and inheritance taxes
then generally viewed as populist or democratic measures he even took
the stand that such taxes should be laid in order to bring about a more
equitable distribution of wealth and greater equality of opportunity
among citizens


legislative and executive activities

economic legislationwhen president roosevelt turned from the field
of opinion he found himself in a different sphere many of his views
were too advanced for the members of his party in congress and where
results depended upon the making of new laws his progress was slow
nevertheless in his administrations several measures were enacted that
bore the stamp of his theories though it could hardly be said that he
dominated congress to the same degree as did some other presidents the
hepburn railway act of  enlarged the interstate commerce commission
it extended the commissions power over oil pipe lines express
companies and other interstate carriers it gave the commission the
right to reduce rates found to be unreasonable and discriminatory it
forbade midnight tariffs that is sudden changes in rates favoring
certain shippers and it prohibited common carriers from transporting
goods owned by themselves especially coal except for their own proper
use two important pure food and drug laws enacted during the same
year were designed to protect the public against diseased meats and
deleterious foods and drugs a significant piece of labor legislation
was an act of the same congress making interstate railways liable to
damages for injuries sustained by their employees when this measure was
declared unconstitutional by the supreme court it was reenacted with the
objectionable clauses removed a second installment of labor legislation
was offered in the law of  limiting the hours of railway employees
engaged as trainmen or telegraph operators

reclamation and conservationthe open countrythe deserts the
forests waterways and the public landsinterested president roosevelt
no less than railway and industrial questions indeed in his first
message to congress he placed the conservation of natural resources
among the most vital internal problems of the age and forcibly
emphasized an issue that had been discussed in a casual way since
clevelands first administration the suggestion evoked an immediate
response in congress under the leadership of senator newlands of
nevada the reclamation act of  was passed providing for the
redemption of the desert areas of the west the proceeds from the sale
of public lands were dedicated to the construction of storage dams and
sluiceways to hold water and divert it as needed to the thirsty sands
furthermore it was stipulated that the rents paid by water users should
go into a reclamation fund to continue the good work forever
construction was started immediately under the terms of the law within
seventeen years about  acres had been reclaimed and more than a
million were actually irrigated in the single year  the crops of
the irrigated districts were valued at approximately 

in his first message also president roosevelt urged the transfer of
all control over national forests to trained men in the bureau of
forestrya recommendation carried out in  when the forestry service
was created in every direction noteworthy advances were made in the
administration of the national domain the science of forestry was
improved and knowledge of the subject spread among the people lands in
the national forest available for agriculture were opened to settlers
water power sites on the public domain were leased for a term of years
to private companies instead of being sold outright the area of the
national forests was enlarged from  million acres to  million acres
by presidential proclamationmore than  million acres being added in
one year  the men who turned sheep and cattle to graze on the
public lands were compelled to pay a fair rental much to their
dissatisfaction fire prevention work was undertaken in the forests on a
large scale reducing the appalling annual destruction of timber
millions of acres of coal land such as the government had been
carelessly selling to mining companies at low figures were withdrawn
from sale and held until congress was prepared to enact laws for the
disposition of them in the public interest prosecutions were
instituted against men who had obtained public lands by fraud and vast
tracts were recovered for the national domain an agitation was begun
which bore fruit under the administrations of taft and wilson in laws
reserving to the federal government the ownership of coal water power
phosphates and other natural resources while authorizing corporations
to develop them under leases for a period of years

the prosecution of the trustsas an executive president roosevelt
was also a distinct personality his discrimination between good and
bad trusts led him to prosecute some of them with vigor on his
initiative the northern securities company formed to obtain control of
certain great western railways was dissolved by order of the supreme
court proceedings were instituted against the american tobacco company
and the standard oil company as monopolies in violation of the sherman
antitrust law the sugar trust was found guilty of cheating the new
york customs house and some of the minor officers were sent to prison
frauds in the postoffice department were uncovered and the offenders
brought to book in fact hardly a week passed without stirring news of
wrong doers and malefactors haled into federal courts

the great coal strikethe roosevelt theory that the president could
do anything for public welfare not forbidden by the constitution and the
laws was put to a severe test in  a strike of the anthracite coal
miners which started in the summer ran late into the autumn
industries were paralyzed for the want of coal cities were threatened
with the appalling menace of a winter without heat governors and mayors
were powerless and appealed for aid the mine owners rejected the
demands of the men and refused to permit the arbitration of the points
in dispute although john mitchell the leader of the miners repeatedly
urged it after observing closely the course affairs president
roosevelt made up his mind that the situation was intolerable he
arranged to have the federal troops if necessary take possession of
the mines and operate them until the strike could be settled he then
invited the contestants to the white house and by dint of hard labor
induced them to accept as a substitute or compromise arbitration by a
commission which he appointed thus by stepping outside the
constitution and acting as the first citizen of the land president
roosevelt averted a crisis of great magnitude

the election of the views and measures which he advocated with
such vigor aroused deep hostility within as well as without his party
there were rumors of a republican movement to defeat his nomination in
 and it was said that the financial and corporation interests were
in arms against him a prominent republican paper in new york city
accused him of having stolen mr bryans thunder by harrying the
trusts and favoring labor unions when the republican convention
assembled in chicago however the opposition disappeared and roosevelt
was nominated by acclamation

this was the signal for a change on the part of democratic leaders they
denounced the president as erratic dangerous and radical and decided
to assume the moderate role themselves they put aside mr bryan and
selected as their candidate judge alton b parker of new york a man

who repudiated free silver and made a direct appeal for the conservative
vote the outcome of the reversal was astounding judge parkers vote
fell more than a million below that cast for bryan in  of the 
electoral votes he received only  roosevelt in addition to sweeping
the republican sections even invaded democratic territory carrying the
state of missouri thus vindicated at the polls he became more
outspoken than ever his leadership in the party was so widely
recognized that he virtually selected his own successor


the administration of president taft

the campaign of long before the end of his elective term
president roosevelt let it be known that he favored as his successor
william howard taft of ohio his secretary of war to attain this end
he used every shred of his powerful influence when the republican
convention assembled mr taft easily won the nomination though the
party platform was conservative in tone he gave it a progressive tinge
by expressing his personal belief in the popular election of united
states senators an income tax and other liberal measures president
roosevelt announced his faith in the republican candidate and appealed
to the country for his election

the turn in republican affairs now convinced mr bryan that the signs
were propitious for a third attempt to win the presidency the disaster
to judge parker had taught the party that victory did not lie in a
conservative policy with little difficulty therefore the veteran
leader from nebraska once more rallied the democrats around his
standard won the nomination and wrote a platform vigorously attacking
the tariff trusts and monopolies supported by a loyal following he
entered the lists only to meet another defeat though he polled almost
a million and a half more votes than did judge parker in  the palm
went to mr taft

the tariff revision and party dissensionsat the very beginning of
his term president taft had to face the tariff issue he had met it in
the campaign moved by the democratic demand for a drastic reduction he
had expressed opinions which were thought to imply a downward
revision the democrats made much of the implication and the
republicans from the middle west rejoiced in it pressure was coming
from all sides more than ten years had elapsed since the enactment of
the dingley bill and the position of many industries had been altered
with the course of time evidently the day for revisionat best a
thankless taskhad arrived taft accepted the inevitable and called
congress in a special session until the midsummer of  republican
senators and representatives wrangled over tariff schedules the
president making little effort to influence their decisions when on
august  the paynealdrich bill became a law a breach had been made in
republican ranks powerful senators from the middle west had spoken
angrily against many of the high rates imposed by the bill they had
even broken with their party colleagues to vote against the entire
scheme of tariff revision

the income tax amendmentthe rift in party harmony was widened by
another serious difference of opinion during the debate on the tariff
bill there was a concerted movement to include in it an income tax
provisionthis in spite of the decision of the supreme court in 
declaring it unconstitutional conservative men were alarmed by the
evident willingness of some members to flout a solemn decree of that
eminent tribunal at the same time they saw a powerful combination of
republicans and democrats determined upon shifting some of the burden of
taxation to large incomes in the press of circumstances a compromise
was reached the income tax bill was dropped for the present but
congress passed the sixteenth amendment to the constitution authorizing
taxes upon incomes from whatever source they might be derived without
reference to any apportionment among the states on the basis of
population the states ratified the amendment and early in  it was
proclaimed

president tafts policiesafter the enactment of the tariff bill
taft continued to push forward with his legislative program he
recommended and congress created a special court of commerce with
jurisdiction among other things over appeals from the interstate
commerce commission thus facilitating judicial review of the railway
rates fixed and the orders issued by that body this measure was quickly
followed by an act establishing a system of postal savings banks in
connection with the post officea scheme which had long been opposed by
private banks two years later congress defied the lobby of the express
companies and supplemented the savings banks with a parcels post system
thus enabling the american postal service to catch up with that of other
progressive nations with a view to improving the business
administration of the federal government the president obtained from
congress a large appropriation for an economy and efficiency commission
charged with the duty of inquiring into wasteful and obsolete methods
and recommending improved devices and practices the chief result of
this investigation was a vigorous report in favor of a national budget
system which soon found public backing

president taft negotiated with england and france general treaties
providing for the arbitration of disputes which were justiciable in
character even though they might involve questions of vital interest
and national honor they were coldly received in the senate and so
amended that taft abandoned them altogether a tariff reciprocity
agreement with canada however he forced through congress in the face
of strong opposition from his own party after making a serious breach
in republican ranks he was chagrined to see the whole scheme come to
naught by the overthrow of the liberals in the canadian elections of


prosecution of the truststhe party schism was even enlarged by what
appeared to be the successful prosecution of several great combinations
in two important cases the supreme court ordered the dissolution of the
standard oil company and the american tobacco company on the ground that
they violated the sherman antitrust law in taking this step chief
justice white was at some pains to state that the law did not apply to
combinations which did not unduly restrain trade his remark
construed to mean that the court would not interfere with corporations
as such became the subject of a popular outcry against the president
and the judges


progressive insurgency and the election of 

growing dissensionsall in all tafts administration from the first
day had been disturbed by party discord high words had passed over the
tariff bill and disgruntled members of congress could not forget them
to differences over issues were added quarrels between youth and old
age in the house of representatives there developed a group of young
insurgent republicans who resented the dominance of the speaker
joseph g cannon and other members of the old guard as they named
the men of long service and conservative minds in  the insurgents
went so far as to join with the democrats in a movement to break the
speakers sway by ousting him from the rules committee and depriving him
of the power to appoint its members the storm was brewing in the
autumn of that year the democrats won a clear majority in the house of
representatives and began an open battle with president taft by
demanding an immediate downward revision of the tariff

the rise of the progressive republicanspreparatory to the campaign
of  the dissenters within the republican party added the prefix
progressive to their old title and began to organize a movement to
prevent the renomination of mr taft as early as january   they
formed a progressive republican league at the home of senator la
follette of wisconsin and launched an attack on the taft measures and
policies in october they indorsed mr la follette as the logical
republican candidate and appealed to the party for support the
controversy over the tariff had grown into a formidable revolt against
the occupant of the white house

roosevelt in the fieldafter looking on for a while expresident
roosevelt took a hand in the fray soon after his return in  from a
hunting trip in africa and a tour in europe he made a series of
addresses in which he formulated a progressive program in a speech in
kansas he favored regulation of the trusts a graduated income tax
bearing heavily on great fortunes tariff revision schedule by schedule
conservation of natural resources labor legislation the direct
primary and the recall of elective officials in an address before the
ohio state constitutional convention in february  he indorsed the
initiative and referendum and announced a doctrine known as the recall
of judicial decisions this was a new and radical note in american
politics an expresident of the united states proposed that the people
at the polls should have the right to reverse the decision of a judge
who set aside any act of a state legislature passed in the interests of
social welfare the progressive republicans impressed by these
addresses turned from la follette to roosevelt and on february 
induced him to come out openly as a candidate against taft for the
republican nomination

the split in the republican partythe country then witnessed the
strange spectacle of two men who had once been close companions engaged
in a bitter rivalry to secure a majority of the delegates to the
republican convention to be held at chicago when the convention
assembled about onefourth of the seats were contested the delegates
for both candidates loudly proclaiming the regularity of their election
in deciding between the contestants the national committee after the
usual hearings settled the disputes in such a way that taft received a
safe majority after a week of negotiation roosevelt and his followers
left the republican party most of his supporters withdrew from the
convention and the few who remained behind refused to answer the roll
call undisturbed by this formidable bolt the regular republicans went
on with their work they renominated mr taft and put forth a platform
roundly condemning such progressive doctrines as the recall of judges

the formation of the progressive partythe action of the republicans
in seating the taft delegates was vigorously denounced by roosevelt he
declared that the convention had no claim to represent the voters of the
republican party that any candidate named by it would be the
beneficiary of a successful fraud and that it would be deeply
discreditable to any man to accept the conventions approval under such
circumstances the bitterness of his followers was extreme on july  a
call went forth for a progressive convention to be held in chicago on
august  the assembly which duly met on that day was a unique political
conference prominence was given to women delegates and politicians
were notably absent roosevelt himself who was cheered as a conquering
hero made an impassioned speech setting forth his confession of
faith he was nominated by acclamation governor hiram johnson of
california was selected as his companion candidate for vice president
the platform endorsed such political reforms as woman suffrage direct
primaries the initiative referendum and recall popular election of
united states senators and the short ballot it favored a program of
social legislation including the prohibition of child labor and minimum
wages for women it approved the regulation rather than the
dissolution of the trusts like apostles in a new and lofty cause the
progressives entered a vigorous campaign for the election of their
distinguished leader

woodrow wilson and the election of with the republicans
divided victory loomed up before the democrats naturally a terrific
contest over the nomination occurred at their convention in baltimore
champ clark speaker of the house of representatives and governor
woodrow wilson of new jersey were the chief contestants after tossing
to and fro for seven long hot days and taking fortysix ballots the
delegates powerfully influenced by mr bryan finally decided in favor
of the governor as a professor a writer on historical and political
subjects and the president of princeton university mr wilson had
become widely known in public life as the governor of new jersey he had
attracted the support of the progressives in both parties with grim
determination he had waged war on the bosses and pushed through the
legislature measures establishing direct primaries regulating public
utilities and creating a system of workmens compensation in
industries during the presidential campaign that followed governor
wilson toured the country and aroused great enthusiasm by a series of
addresses later published under the title of the new freedom he
declared that the government of the united states is at present the
foster child of the special interests he proposed to free the country
by breaking the dominance of the big bankers the big manufacturers
the big masters of commerce the heads of railroad corporations and of
steamship corporations

in the election governor wilson easily secured a majority of the
electoral votes and his party while retaining possession of the house
of representatives captured the senate as well the popular verdict
however indicated a state of confusion in the country the combined
progressive and republican vote exceeded that of the democrats by
 the socialists with eugene v debs as their candidate again
polled about  votes more than double the number received four
years before thus as the result of an extraordinary upheaval the
republicans after holding the office of president for sixteen years
passed out of power and the government of the country was intrusted to
the democrats under the leadership of a man destined to be one of the
outstanding figures of the modern age woodrow wilson

chapter xxii

the spirit of reform in america


an age of criticism

attacks on abuses in american lifethe crisis precipitated by the
progressive uprising was not a sudden and unexpected one it had been
long in preparation the revolt against corruption in politics which
produced the liberal republican outbreak in the seventies and the
mugwump movement of the eighties was followed by continuous criticism of
american political and economic development from  until his death
in  george william curtis as president of the civil service reform
association kept up a running fire upon the abuses of the spoils
system james bryce an observant english scholar and man of affairs in
his great work the american commonwealth published in  by
picturing fearlessly the political rings and machines which dominated
the cities gave the whole country a fresh shock six years later henry
d lloyd in a powerful book entitled wealth against commonwealth
attacked in scathing language certain trusts which had destroyed their
rivals and bribed public officials in  miss ida tarbell an author
of established reputation in the historical field gave to the public an
account of the standard oil company revealing the ruthless methods of
that corporation in crushing competition about the same time lincoln
steffens exposed the sordid character of politics in several
municipalities in a series of articles bearing the painful heading the
shame of the cities the critical spirit appeared in almost every form
in weekly and monthly magazines in essays and pamphlets in editorials
and news stories in novels like churchills coniston and sinclairs
the jungle it became so savage and so wanton that the opening years
of the twentieth century were well named the age of the muckrakers

the subjects of the criticismin this outburst of invective nothing
was spared it was charged that each of the political parties had fallen
into the hands of professional politicians who devoted their time to
managing conventions making platforms nominating candidates and
dictating to officials in return for their services they sold offices
and privileges it was alleged that mayors and councils had bargained
away for private benefit street railway and other franchises it was
asserted that many powerful labor unions were dominated by men who
blackmailed employers some critics specialized in descriptions of the
poverty slums and misery of great cities others took up frenzied
finance and accused financiers of selling worthless stocks and bonds to
an innocent public still others professed to see in the accumulations
of millionaires the downfall of our republic

the attack on invisible governmentsome even maintained that the
control of public affairs had passed from the people to a sinister
minority called the invisible government so eminent and conservative
a statesman as the hon elihu root lent the weight of his great name to
such an imputation speaking of his native state new york he said
what is the government of this state what has it been during the forty
years of my acquaintance with it the government of the constitution
oh no not half the time or half way from the days of fenton and
conkling and arthur and cornell and platt from the days of david b
hill down to the present time the government of the state has presented
two different lines of activity one of the constitutional and
statutory officers of the state and the other of the party leaders they
call them party bosses they call the systemi dont coin the
phrasethe system they call invisible government for i dont know
how many years mr conkling was the supreme ruler in this state the
governor did not count the legislature did not count comptrollers and
secretaries of state and what not did not count it was what mr
conkling said and in a great outburst of public rage he was pulled
down then mr platt ruled the state for nigh upon twenty years he
ruled it it was not the governor it was not the legislature it was
mr platt and the capital was not here in albany it was at 
broadway mr platt and his lieutenants it makes no difference what
name you give whether you call it fenton or conkling or cornell or
arthur or platt or by the names of men now living the ruler of the
state during the greater part of the forty years of my acquaintance with
the state government has not been any man authorized by the constitution
or by law the party leader is elected by no one accountable to no
one bound by no oath of office removable by no one

the nation arousedwith the spirit of criticism came also the spirit
of reform the charges were usually exaggerated often wholly false but
there was enough truth in them to warrant renewed vigilance on the part
of american democracy president roosevelt doubtless summed up the
sentiment of the great majority of citizens when he demanded the
punishment of wrongdoers in  saying it makes not a particle of
difference whether these crimes are committed by a capitalist or by a
laborer by a leading banker or manufacturer or railroad man or by a
leading representative of a labor union swindling in stocks corrupting
legislatures making fortunes by the inflation of securities by
wrecking railroads by destroying competitors through rebatesthese
forms of wrongdoing in the capitalist are far more infamous than any
ordinary form of embezzlement or forgery the time had come he added
to stop muckraking and proceed to the constructive work of removing
the abuses that had grown up


political reforms

the public serviceit was a wise comprehension of the needs of
american democracy that led the friends of reform to launch and to
sustain for more than half a century a movement to improve the public
service on the one side they struck at the spoils system at the right
of the politicians to use public offices as mere rewards for partisan
work the federal civil service act of  opened the way to reform by
establishing five vital principles in law  admission to office not
on the recommendation of party workers but on the basis of competitive
examinations  promotion for meritorious service of the government
rather than of parties  no assessment of office holders for campaign
funds  permanent tenure during good behavior and  no dismissals
for political reasons the act itself at first applied to only 
federal offices but under the constant pressure from the reformers it
was extended until in  it covered nearly  employees out of an
executive force of approximately  while gaining steadily at
washington civil service reformers carried their agitation into the
states and cities by  they were able to report ten states with
civil service commissions and the merit system well intrenched in more
than three hundred municipalities

in excluding spoilsmen from public office the reformers were in a
sense engaged in a negative work that of keeping the rascals out
but there was a second and larger phase to their movement one
constructive in character that of getting skilled loyal and efficient
servants into the places of responsibility everywhere on land and sea
in town and country new burdens were laid upon public officers they
were called upon to supervise the ships sailing to and from our ports
to inspect the water and milk supplies of our cities to construct and
operate great public works such as the panama and erie canals to
regulate the complicated rates of railway companies to safeguard health
and safety in a thousand ways to climb the mountains to fight forest
fires and to descend into the deeps of the earth to combat the deadly
coal gases that assail the miners in a word those who labored to
master the secrets and the powers of nature were summoned to the aid of
the government chemists engineers architects nurses surgeons
forestersthe skilled in all the sciences arts and crafts

keeping rascals out was no task at all compared with the problem of
finding competent people for all the technical offices now said the
reformers we must make attractive careers in the government work for
the best american talent we must train those applying for admission and
increase the skill of those already in positions of trust we must see
to it that those entering at the bottom have a chance to rise to the
top in short we must work for a government as skilled and efficient as
it is strong one commanding all the wisdom and talent of america that
public welfare requires

the australian ballota second line of attack on the political
machines was made in connection with the ballot in the early days
elections were frequently held in the open air and the poll was taken by
a show of hands or by the enrollment of the voters under names of their
favorite candidates when this ancient practice was abandoned in favor
of the printed ballot there was still no secrecy about elections each
party prepared its own ballot often of a distinctive color containing
the names of its candidates on election day these papers were handed
out to the voters by party workers any one could tell from the color of
the ballot dropped into the box or from some mark on the outside of the
folded ballot just how each man voted those who bought votes were sure
that their purchases were delivered those who intimidated voters
could know when their intimidation was effective in this way the party
ballot strengthened the party machine

as a remedy for such abuses reformers learning from the experience of
australia urged the adoption of the australian ballot that ballot
though it appeared in many forms had certain constant features it was
official that is furnished by the government not by party workers it
contained the names of all candidates of all parties it was given out
only in the polling places and it was marked in secret the first state
to introduce it was massachusetts the year was  before the end of
the century it had been adopted by nearly all the states in the union
the salutary effect of the reform in reducing the amount of cheating
and bribery in elections was beyond all question

the direct primaryin connection with the uprising against machine
politics came a call for the abolition of the old method of nominating
candidates by conventions these timehonored party assemblies which
had come down from the days of andrew jackson were it was said merely
conclaves of party workers sustained by the spoils system and
dominated by an inner circle of bosses the remedy offered in this case
was again more democracy namely the abolition of the party
convention and the adoption of the direct primary candidates were no
longer to be chosen by secret conferences any member of a party was to
be allowed to run for any office to present his name to his party by
securing signatures to a petition and to submit his candidacy to his
fellow partisans at a direct primaryan election within the party in
this movement governor la follette of wisconsin took the lead and his
state was the first in the union to adopt the direct primary for
statewide purposes the idea spread rapidly in the west more slowly
in the east the public already angered against the bosses grasped
eagerly at it governor hughes in new york pressed it upon the unwilling
legislature state after state accepted it until by  rhode island
delaware connecticut and new mexico were the only states that had not
bowed to the storm still the results were disappointing and at that
very time the pendulum was beginning to swing backward

popular election of federal senatorswhile the movement for direct
primaries was still advancing everywhere a demand for the popular
election of senators usually associated with it swept forward to
victory under the original constitution it had been expressly provided
that senators should be chosen by the legislatures of the states in
practice this rule transferred the selection of senators to secret
caucuses of party members in the state legislatures in connection with
these caucuses there had been many scandals some direct proofs of
brazen bribery and corruption and dark hints besides the senate was
called by its detractors a millionaires club and it was looked upon
as the citadel of conservatism the prescription in this case was
likewise more democracydirect election of senators by popular vote

this reform was not a new idea it had been proposed in congress as
early as  president johnson an ardent advocate made it the
subject of a special message in  not long afterward it appeared in
congress at last in  the year after the great populist upheaval
the house of representatives by the requisite twothirds vote
incorporated it in an amendment to the federal constitution again and
again it passed the house but the senate itself was obdurate able
senators leveled their batteries against it mr hoar of massachusetts
declared that it would transfer the seat of power to the great cities
and masses of population that it would overthrow the whole scheme of
the senate and in the end the whole scheme of the national constitution
as designed and established by the framers of the constitution and the
people who adopted it

failing in the senate advocates of popular election made a rear assault
through the states they induced state legislatures to enact laws
requiring the nomination of candidates for the senate by the direct
primary and then they bound the legislatures to abide by the popular
choice nevada took the lead in  shortly afterward oregon by the
use of the initiative and referendum practically bound legislators to
accept the popular nominee and the country witnessed the spectacle of a
republican legislature electing a democrat to represent the state in
the senate at washington by  threefourths of the states had
applied the direct primary in some form to the choice of senators men
selected by that method began to pour in upon the floors of congress
finally in  the twothirds majority was secured for an amendment to
the federal constitution providing for the popular election of senators
it was quickly ratified by the states the following year it was
proclaimed in effect

the initiative and referendumas a corrective for the evils which
had grown up in state legislatures there arose a demand for the
introduction of a swiss device known as the initiative and referendum
the initiative permits any one to draw up a proposed bill and on
securing a certain number of signatures among the voters to require the
submission of the measure to the people at an election if the bill thus
initiated receives a sufficient majority it becomes a law the
referendum allows citizens who disapprove any act passed by the
legislature to get up a petition against it and thus bring about a
reference of the measure to the voters at the polls for approval or
rejection these two practices constitute a form of direct government

these devices were prescribed to restore the government to the people
the populists favored them in their platform of  mr bryan two
years later made them a part of his program and in the same year south
dakota adopted them in  oregon after a strenuous campaign added a
direct legislation amendment to the state constitution within ten years
all the southwestern mountain and pacific states except texas and
wyoming had followed this example to the east of the mississippi
however direct legislation met a chilly reception by  only five
states in this section had accepted it maine massachusetts ohio
michigan and maryland the last approving the referendum only

the recallexecutive officers and judges as well as legislatures
had come in for their share of criticism and it was proposed that they
should likewise be subjected to a closer scrutiny by the public for
this purpose there was advanced a scheme known as the recallwhich
permitted a certain percentage of the voters to compel any officer at
any time during his term to go before the people at a new election
this feature of direct government tried out first in the city of los
angeles was extended to statewide uses in oregon in  it failed
however to capture popular imagination to the same degree as the
initiative and referendum at the end of ten years agitation only ten
states mainly in the west had adopted it for general purposes and
four of them did not apply it to the judges of the courts still it was
extensively acclaimed in cities and incorporated into hundreds of
municipal laws and charters

as a general proposition direct government in all its forms was
bitterly opposed by men of a conservative cast of mind it was denounced
by senator henry cabot lodge as nothing less than a complete revolution
in the fabric of our government and in the fundamental principles upon
which that government rests in his opinion it promised to break down
the representative principle and undermine and overthrow the bulwarks
of ordered liberty and individual freedom mr taft shared mr lodges
views and spoke of direct government with scorn votes he exclaimed
are not bread  referendums do not pay rent or furnish houses
recalls do not furnish clothes initiatives do not supply employment or
relieve inequalities of condition or of opportunity

commission government for citiesin the restless searching out of
evils the management of cities early came under critical scrutiny city
government mr bryce had remarked was the one conspicuous failure in
america this sharp thrust though resented by some was accepted as a
warning by others many prescriptions were offered by doctors of the
body politic chief among them was the idea of simplifying the city
government so that the light of public scrutiny could shine through it
let us elect only a few men and make them clearly responsible for the
city government was the new cry in municipal reform so many city
councils were reduced in size one of the two houses which several
cities had adopted in imitation of the federal government was
abolished and in order that the mayor could be held to account he was
given the power to appoint all the chief officials this made the mayor
in some cases the only elective city official and gave the voters a
short ballot containing only a few namesan idea which some proposed
to apply also to the state government

a further step in the concentration of authority was taken in galveston
texas where the people looking upon the ruin of their city wrought by
the devastating storm of  and confronted by the difficult problems
of reconstruction felt the necessity for a more businesslike management
of city affairs and instituted a new form of local administration they
abolished the old scheme of mayor and council and vested all power in
five commissioners one of whom without any special prerogatives was
assigned to the office of mayor president in  the commission
form of government as it was soon characterized was adopted by des
moines iowa the attention of all municipal reformers was drawn to it
and it was hailed as the guarantee of a better day by  more than
four hundred cities including memphis spokane birmingham newark and
buffalo had adopted it still the larger cities like new york and
chicago kept their boards of aldermen

the city manager plana few years experience with commission
government revealed certain patent defects the division of the work
among five men was frequently found to introduce dissensions and
irresponsibility commissioners were often lacking in the technical
ability required to manage such difficult matters as fire and police
protection public health public works and public utilities some one
then proposed to carry over into city government an idea from the
business world in that sphere the stockholders of each corporation
elect the directors and the directors in turn choose a business
manager to conduct the affairs of the company it was suggested that the
city commissioners instead of attempting to supervise the details of
the city administration should select a manager to do this the scheme
was put into effect in sumter south carolina in  like the
commission plan it became popular within eight years more than one
hundred and fifty towns and cities had adopted it among the larger
municipalities were dayton springfield ohio akron kalamazoo and
phoenix it promised to create a new public service profession that of
city manager


measures of economic reform

the spirit of american reformthe purification of the ballot the
restriction of the spoils system the enlargement of direct popular
control over the organs of government were not the sole answers made by
the reformers to the critics of american institutions nor were they the
most important in fact they were regarded not as ends in themselves
but as means to serve a wider purpose that purpose was the promotion of
the general welfare the concrete objects covered by that broad term
were many and varied but they included the prevention of extortion by
railway and other corporations the protection of public health the
extension of education the improvement of living conditions in the
cities the elimination of undeserved poverty the removal of gross
inequalities in wealth and more equality of opportunity

all these things involved the use of the powers of government although
a few clung to the ancient doctrine that the government should not
interfere with private business at all the american people at large
rejected that theory as vigorously as they rejected the doctrines of an
extreme socialism which exalts the state above the individual leaders
representing every shade of opinion proclaimed the government an
instrument of common welfare to be used in the public interest we must
abandon definitely said roosevelt the laissezfaire theory of
political economy and fearlessly champion a system of increased
governmental control paying no attention to the cries of worthy people
who denounce this as socialistic this view was shared by mr taft who
observed undoubtedly the government can wisely do much more  to
relieve the oppressed to create greater equality of opportunity to
make reasonable terms for labor in employment and to furnish vocational
education he was quick to add his caution that there is a line beyond
which the government cannot go with any good practical results in
seeking to make men and society better

the regulation of railwaysthe first attempts to use the government
in a large way to control private enterprise in the public interest were
made by the northwestern states in the decade between  and 
charges were advanced by the farmers particularly those organized into
granges that the railways extorted the highest possible rates for
freight and passengers that favoritism was shown to large shippers
that fraudulent stocks and bonds were sold to the innocent public it
was claimed that railways were not like other enterprises but were
quasipublic concerns like the roads and ferries and thus subject to
government control accordingly laws were enacted bringing the railroads
under state supervision in some cases the state legislature fixed the
maximum rates to be charged by common carriers and in other cases
commissions were created with the power to establish the rates after an
investigation this legislation was at first denounced in the east as
nothing less than the confiscation of the railways in the interest of
the farmers attempts to have the supreme court of the united states
declare it unconstitutional were made without avail still a principle
was finally laid down to the effect that in fixing rates state
legislatures and commissions must permit railway companies to earn a
fair return on the capital invested

in a few years the granger spirit appeared in congress an investigation
revealed a long list of abuses committed by the railways against
shippers and travelers the result was the interstate commerce act of
 which created the interstate commerce commission forbade
discriminations in rates and prohibited other objectionable practices
on the part of railways this measure was loosely enforced and the
abuses against which it was directed continued almost unabated a demand
for stricter control grew louder and louder congress was forced to
heed in  it enacted the elkins law forbidding railways to charge
rates other than those published and laid penalties upon the officers
and agents of companies who granted secret favors to shippers and upon
shippers who accepted them three years later a still more drastic step
was taken by the passage of the hepburn act the interstate commerce
commission was authorized upon complaint of some party aggrieved and
after a public hearing to determine whether just and reasonable rates
had been charged by the companies in effect the right to fix freight
and passenger rates was taken out of the hands of the owners of the
railways engaged in interstate commerce and vested in the hands of the
interstate commerce commission thus private property to the value of
 or more was declared to be a matter of public concern
and subject to government regulation in the common interest

municipal utilitiessimilar problems arose in connection with the
street railways electric light plants and other utilities in the great
cities in the beginning the right to construct such undertakings was
freely and often corruptly granted to private companies by city
councils distressing abuses arose in connection with such practices
many grants or franchises were made perpetual or perhaps for a term of
 years the rates charged and services rendered were left largely to
the will of the companies holding the franchises mergers or unions of
companies were common and the public was deluged with stocks and bonds
of doubtful value bankruptcies were frequent the connection between
the utility companies and the politicians was to say the least not
always in the public interest

american ingenuity was quick to devise methods for eliminating such
evils three lines of progress were laid out by the reformers one group
proposed that such utilities should be subject to municipal or state
regulation that the formation of utility companies should be under
public control and that the issue of stocks and bonds must be approved
by public authority in some cases state and in other cases municipal
commissions were created to exercise this great power over quasipublic
corporations wisconsin by laws enacted in  put all heat light
water works telephone and street railway companies under the
supervision of a single railway commission other states followed this
example rapidly by  the principle of public control over municipal
utilities was accepted in nearly every section of the union

a second line of reform appeared in the model franchise for utility
corporations an illustration of this tendency was afforded by the
chicago street railway settlement of  the total capital of the
company was fixed at a definite sum its earnings were agreed upon and
the city was given the right to buy and operate the system if it desired
to do so in many states about the same time it was provided that no
franchises to utility companies could run more than twentyfive years

a third group of reformers were satisfied with nothing short of
municipal ownership they proposed to drive private companies entirely
out of the field and vest the ownership and management of municipal
plants in the city itself this idea was extensively applied to electric
light and water works plants but to street railways in only a few
cities including san francisco and seattle in new york the subways are
owned by the city but leased for operation

tenement house controlamong the other pressing problems of the
cities was the overcrowding in houses unfit for habitation an inquiry
in new york city made under the authority of the state in  revealed
poverty misery slums dirt and disease almost beyond imagination the
immediate answer was the enactment of a tenement house law prescribing
in great detail the size of the rooms the air space the light and the
sanitary arrangement for all new buildings an immense improvement
followed and the idea was quickly taken up in other states having large
industrial centers in  new york made a further invasion of the
rights of landlords by assuring to the public reasonable rents for
flats and apartments

workmens compensationno small part of the poverty in cities was
due to the injury of wageearners while at their trade every year the
number of men and women killed or wounded in industry mounted higher
under the old law the workman or his family had to bear the loss unless
the employer had been guilty of some extraordinary negligence even in
that case an expensive lawsuit was usually necessary to recover
damages in short although employers insured their buildings and
machinery against necessary risks from fire and storm they allowed
their employees to assume the heavy losses due to accidents the
injustice of this though apparent enough now was once not generally
recognized it was said to be unfair to make the employer pay for
injuries for which he was not personally responsible but the argument
was overborne

illustration an east side street in new york

about  there set in a decided movement in the direction of lifting
the burden of accidents from the unfortunate victims in the first
place laws were enacted requiring employers to pay damages in certain
amounts according to the nature of the case no matter how the accident
occurred as long as the injured person was not guilty of willful
negligence by  more than onehalf the states had such laws in the
second place there developed schemes of industrial insurance in the
form of automatic grants made by state commissions to persons injured in
industries the funds to be provided by the employers or the state or by
both by  thirtysix states had legislation of this type

minimum wages and mothers pensionsanother source of poverty
especially among women and children was found to be the low wages paid
for their labor report after report showed this in  massachusetts
took a significant step in the direction of declaring the minimum wages
which might be paid to women and children oregon the following year
created a commission with power to prescribe minimum wages in certain
industries based on the cost of living and to enforce the rates fixed
within a short time onethird of the states had legislation of this
character to cut away some of the evils of poverty and enable widows to
keep their homes intact and bring up their children a device known as
mothers pensions became popular during the second decade of the
twentieth century at the opening of  two states colorado and
illinois had laws authorizing the payment from public funds of definite
sums to widows with children within four years thirtyfive states had
similar legislation

taxation and great fortunesas a part of the campaign waged against
poverty by reformers there came a demand for heavy taxes upon great
fortunes particularly taxes upon inheritances or estates passing to
heirs on the decease of the owners roosevelt was an ardent champion of
this type of taxation and dwelt upon it at length in his message to
congress in  such a tax he said would help to preserve a
measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations
growing to manhood our aim is to recognize what lincoln pointed out
the fact that there are some respects in which men are obviously not
equal but also to insist that there should be equality of selfrespect
and of mutual respect an equality of rights before the law and at
least an approximate equality in the conditions under which each man
obtains the chance to show the stuff that is in him when compared with
his fellows

the spirit of the new age was therefore one of reform not of
revolution it called for no evolutionary or utopian experiments but
for the steady and progressive enactment of measures aimed at admitted
abuses and designed to accomplish tangible results in the name of public
welfare

chapter xxiii

the new political democracy


women in public affairsthe social legislation enacted in response
to the spirit of reform vitally affected women in the home and in
industry and was promoted by their organizations where they did not
lead they were affiliated with movements for social improvement no
cause escaped their attention no year passed without widening the range
of their interests they served on committees that inquired into the
problems of the day they appeared before legislative assemblies to
advocate remedies for the evils they discovered by  they were a
force to be reckoned with in national politics in nine states complete
and equal suffrage had been established and a widespread campaign for a
national suffrage amendment was in full swing on every hand lay
evidences that their sphere had been broadened to include public
affairs this was the culmination of forces that had long been
operating

a new emphasis in historya movement so deeply affecting important
interests could not fail to find a place in time in the written record
of human progress history often began as a chronicle of kings and
queens knights and ladies written partly to amuse and partly to
instruct the classes that appeared in its pages with the growth of
commerce parliaments and international relations politics and
diplomacy were added to such chronicles of royal and princely doings
after the rise of democracy industry and organized labor the
transactions of everyday life were deemed worthy of a place in the pages
of history in each case history was rewritten and the past rediscovered
in the light of the new age so it will be with the rise and growth of
womens political power the history of their labor their education
their status in society their influence on the course of events will be
explored and given its place in the general record

it will be a history of change the superior position which women enjoy
in america today is the result of a slow evolution from an almost
rightless condition in colonial times the founders of america brought
with them the english common law under that law a married womans
personal propertyjewels money furniture and the likebecame her
husbands property the management of her lands passed into his control
even the wages she earned if she worked for some one else belonged to
him custom if not law prescribed that women should not take part in
town meetings or enter into public discuss
